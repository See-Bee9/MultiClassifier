                            The on-going developments in laser acceleration of protons and light ions, as well as the production 
                            of strong bursts of neutrons and multi-MeV photons by secondary processes now provide a basis for 
                            novel high-fux nuclear physics experiments. While the maximum energy of protons resulting from 
                            Target Normal Sheath Acceleration is presently still limited to around 100 MeV , the generated proton 
                            peak fux within the short laser-accelerated bunches can already today exceed the values achievable at 
                            the most advanced conventional accelerators by orders of magnitude. This paper consists of two parts 
                            covering the scientifc motivation and relevance of such experiments and a frst proof-of-principle 
                            demonstration. In the presented experiment pulses of 200 J at ≈ 500 fs duration from the PHELIX laser 
                            produced more than 1012 protons with energies above 15 MeV in a bunch of sub-nanosecond duration. 
                            They were used to induce fssion in foil targets made of natural uranium. To make use of the nonpareil 
                            fux, these targets have to be very close to the laser acceleration source, since the particle density 
                            within the bunch is strongly afected by Coulomb explosion and the velocity diferences between ions 
                            of diferent energy. The main challenge for nuclear detection with high-purity germanium detectors 
                            is given by the strong electromagnetic pulse caused by the laser-matter interaction close to the laser 
                            acceleration source. This was mitigated by utilizing fast transport of the fssion products by a gas fow 
                            to a carbon flter, where the γ-rays were registered. The identifed nuclides include those that have 
                            half-lives down to 39 s . These results demonstrate the capability to produce, extract, and detect short-
                            lived reaction products under the demanding experimental condition imposed by the high-power 
                            laser interaction. The approach promotes research towards relevant nuclear astrophysical studies at 
                            conditions currently only accessible at nuclear high energy density laser facilities.

                            At present, Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA)1, 2 produces protons with energies up to around 100 MeV3, 
                            with abundances of more than 1012 protons above 15 MeV4. One of the pre-requisites for TNSA is the necessity to 
                            maintain relativistic intensities during the laser-matter interaction over many tens of femtoseconds, a capability 
                            which is met by low-repetition-rate high-intensity lasers of 10 Hz and below. Tis acceleration scheme opens up 
                            new opportunities for proton-induced reactions that until now have not been possible. Indeed, while the average 
                            proton fux of a laser-based proton source remains low compared to standard accelerators, the peak proton fux 
                            reaches 1022 particles per second within the laser-accelerated particle bunch, which dramatically exceeds the 
                            capabilities of conventional particle accelerators. Tis gives a perspective to probe into new regimes or reliably 
                            trigger and detect processes with small cross-sections at ultrashort lifetimes. Additional improvements of these

                                    Figure 1.  Experimental setup. Te produced protons from TNSA enter the uranium-target container through a 
                                    titanium window. RCFs located in front and behind the uranium-target container measure the proton spectrum. 
                                    Te fssion products are stopped by a gas mixture of helium and argon in the same mass fow proportion 
                                    and transported to a carbon flter 12 m away outside the PHELIX target chamber. Te various γ-lines from the 
                                    transported isotopes are measured with a HPGe detector.


                                    parameters by novel laser-driven acceleration schemes, although not yet substantiated, are expected and will 
                                    increase the proton ­fux5, 6. A requirement is the combination of the laser production method with spectroscopy 
                                    setups and tools, allowing for sensitive nuclear spectroscopy on nuclides with a short half-life. In order to explore 
                                    this new feld, a platform had to be developed that can detect γ-ray and β-particle emission from the fssion 
                                    fragments in the presence of the strong electromagnetic pulse (EMP) created by the laser-matter interaction. 
                                    Such a platform based on the radiochemistry method opens up the possibility for the investigation of nuclear 
                                    excitation processes at the nuclear-atomic interface in high-energy-density (HED) environments­ 7.
                                      Tis present experiment, conducted at the PHELIX facility­ 8, the Petawatt High-Energy Laser for Heavy-Ion 
                                    eXperiments at GSI in Darmstadt, Germany, is part of the early development phase of a platform for future 
                                    nuclear physics experiments at other advanced laser facilities (e. g. ELI-NP (Romania)9, 10 and ARC (LLNL)11). 
                                    Due to its continuous gas fow, the method used is also well suited for high repetitive lasers like ELI-Beamlines 
                                    (Czech Republic)12, BELLA (LBNL)13, Draco (HZDR)14, J-KAREN (KPSI)15, and CoReLS (South Korea)16. Te 
                                    platform utilizes a state-of-the-art short pulse, high temporal contrast, high energy laser (in the experiment 
                                                            −
                                    ≈ 200 J in ≈ 500 fs at < 10 12 temporal contrast) to provide laser-accelerated protons to induce nuclear 
                                    reactions. Te rapid high-efciency detection of reaction products is the primary focus.
                                      In this experiment, we studied proton-induced fssion of uranium, motivated by the appropriate matching of 
                                    the wide cross-section profle to the range of the proton spectrum produced by TNSA. A particularly interesting 
                                    aspect of these experiments with short-pulsed, laser-driven particle beams is that the pulse duration is much 
                                    shorter than in conventional sources and limited only by the laser pulse itself and the associated time-of-fight 
                                    spread of the accelerated ions. An abundance of fssion fragments is produced within this time, providing 
                                    sensitivity to short-lived isotopes. Nuclei with half-lives down to several seconds have been identifed. So far, very 
                                    little experience exists in this short-pulsed time domain. Te transportation of the fragments to the detection 
                                    apparatus can take several seconds, which ultimately impairs sensitivity to very short-lived isomers. Nevertheless, 
                                    the build-up of daughter isotopes from the chain-yield and the γ-rays resulting from their deexcitations can be 
                                    expected in the measured spectra, potentially revealing heretofore unobserved aspects of the reaction process. 
                                    Our successful proof-of-principle experiment opens a new perspective for a variety of nuclear structure and 
                                    nuclear astrophysics, where some of the very small reaction cross-sections with shortest lifetimes require huge 
                                    luminosities not yet available at conventional accelerators.
                                    Results and discussion
                                    Te purpose of this work is to demonstrate the use of laser-accelerated high-fux proton bursts for nuclear physics 
                                    applications. Te immediate goal of this frst beam time was to observe short-lived natU(p,f) fssion products. 
                                    Nuclides with half-lives as short as 39 s were readily identifed in the measured spectra. Observation of products 
                                    with even shorter half-lives requires an upgraded detector setup planned in future studies.
                                      Using the setup described in Fig. 1, two 15-µm-thick uranium foils located 50 and 80 mm away from the 
                                    proton source were irradiated by (1.35 ± 0.12) × 1011 and (0.506 ± 0.047) × 1011 protons with energies above 
                                   15 MeV , respectively, taking into account the solid angle of irradiation. Figure 2 gives the retrieved proton 
                                    spectra for calibration shots using radiochromic flms at imaging spectroscopy (RIS) at the distance of the frst 
                                    uranium foil. Te exponential function is obtained by an iterative ft to the deposited energy in the RCF layers. 
                                    Altogether, this illustrates the statistical and systematic sources of error made in estimating the proton numbers. 
                                    Applied to the uranium target, this corresponds to an efective conversion efciency of (0.50 ± 0.16)% at the frst 
                                    uranium foil and of (0.19 ± 0.06)% at the second, and represents the fraction of laser energy that is converted into

                            source. To refect the aperture of the uranium target container, only 1 cm of the RCFs in the middle were 
                            evaluated. Te exponential function is obtained by an iterative t to the deposited energy in the RCF layers. 
                            Above the dotted line at 15 MeV the protons contribute signifcantly to the fssion process.


                            usable kinetic energy. Te cross-section of proton-induced fssion reaches 500 mb around 15 MeV and is rising 
                            to a maximum of 1.75 b at 70 MeV17, well matching the energy spectrum achieved. Te most energetic protons 
                            arrive at the frst uranium foil in 0.46 ns subsequent to laser irradiation of the gold target, while less energetic 
                            protons with E = 15 MeV arrive at 0.94 ns . Te overall exposure of uranium to the proton fux was shorter than 
                           1 ns , which corresponds to an efective peak current in excess of 1020 protons/s . During the irradiation, gas is 
                            constantly fushed through the uranium target container resulting in the transport of the freshly produced fssion 
                            fragments to a carbon flter located directly in front of an HPGe detector.
                              Te γ spectra recorded by the HPGe detector were analyzed on the basis of published nuclear data ­tables18, 
                            19 for the identifcation of the observed γ-ray peaks, and associated lifetimes. All major volatile fssion product 
                            isotopes having a lifetime in the range of 39.68 s to 14.14 min were identifed. Tese are: 134m I, 136m I, 137Xe, 138Xe, 
                           139Xe, and 140Cs. Figure 3 depicts the γ-ray spectra recorded at three diferent times, 27 (red), 65 (green), and 
                            238 (blue) seconds, respectively, following the laser pulse. Te time information facilitates the identifcation. 
                            Each spectrum represents an accumulation of detected γ-rays up to the indicated times. Te background in the 
                            spectra is low, due to the short integration time and the ability to massively shield the detector against the EMP 
                            and high-energy radiation. Due to a large number of various radioactive nuclei produced in this experiment, we 
                            focused on unambiguous identifcation of abundantly generated fssion products and did not aim at identifcation 
                            of all γ-lines in the spectra. Broader features at low energies may stem from X-ray emission following internal 
                            conversion and positron decays, and secondary excitation from the lead shielding. Neutron-defcient nuclides 
                            responsible for the latter decays are probably produced in proton-induced direct reactions like (p,pn), (p,2n) or 
                            (p,3n). Also, the fragmentation or spallation reactions due to incident protons are not excluded. Te presence of 
                            such neutron-defcient nuclides is evidenced by a relatively strong γ-line = 511 keV responsible for positron-
                            electron annihilation. For these spectra, the results of eleven laser shots are added up. It should be noted that 
                            the γ-lines associated with the nuclei 134m I, 136m I,  and 139 Xe can be clearly extracted even from a single shot, as 
                            they are produced with high enough yield.
                              Table 1 lists the identifed γ-rays present in the spectra. Given are the parent isotope, the respective decay 
                            mode, the associated lifetime, and the γ energy as well as the number of collected nuclides in the flter and the 
                            integral cross-sections. Other γ-ray energies are expected from isotopes produced later in the decay chain but 
                            are not visible due to the selected time window.
                              For comparison, Fig. 4 shows the spectrum of the irradiated uranium targets afer the experiment. In this 
                            spectrum, a large number of reaction products can be identifed, including long-lived daughter nuclei from the 
                            decay chains of fssion fragments and nuclides generated by a direct reaction like 237 U  from 238U(p,pn) and 
                            236 Np  from 238U(p,3n). In addition, γ-lines from the natural decay of uranium appear. Since the spectrum was 
                            taken several hours afer the irradiation, short-lived isotopes are not visible. Tis demonstrates and validates 
                            that the experimental setup enables the detection of short-lived isotopes, that can otherwise not be identifed

                                    Figure 3.  Measured γ spectra and some identifed fssion products. Te spectra were accumulated for periods 
                                    of 27 (red), 65 (green), and 238 (blue) seconds following the laser pulse. For these spectra, the results of eleven 
                                    laser shots are added up.


                                      One interesting feature of this experimental platform is the possibility to calibrate the various modules of-line 
                                    and deliver quantitative reaction yield values. Te proton source is calibrated with radiochromic flms (RCFs), 
                                    which is an established calibration method. RCFs are readily available for medical applications from various 
                                    vendors. By calibrating the RCFs against an external accelerator source, an absolute error in dose deposition 
                                    around 5% is normally achieved. At the other end of the system, the detector efciency was cross-calibrated using 
                                    radioactive sources. Additionally, the losses in the gas transport in the capillary were determined of-line for 
                                    219 Rn to be less than 1% including the capture efciency in the carbon flter. Given that the container reaction 
                                    geometry is well known, this platform could be used to determine integral reaction cross-sections quantitatively. 
                                    For this purpose, the stopping range of the generated fssion fragments and the proportion of the generated 
                                    fssion fragments that can enter the gas was determined. Te number of target particles available for the measured 
                                    fssion products is (1.71 ± 0.11) × 1019 for iodine and (1.56 ± 0.11) × 1019 for xenon depending on the diferent 
                                    stopping range. 10.27% of the iodine and 11.22% of the xenon elements difuse into the gas and have the possibility 
                                    to be stopped there. It should be noted, that the error of the cross-sections are mainly statistical, which can be 
                                    reduced by a longer series of measurements and by adding up several spectra of laser shots. Te ratios between 
                                    the isotopes are completely consistent with literature values­ 20, 21. Te measured cross-sections are too low by a 
                                    factor of 8. Tis has to be explained by defciency of the extraction from the target container.

                              It is important to emphasize that the ability to identify shorter-lived isotopes is improved when lasers such 
                            as PHELIX are utilized. In our realization, the lower limit of observed lifetimes and the restriction to transport 
                            only volatile elements were dictated by the specifc conditions chosen for the gas transport parameters, aiming 
                            for improved operation safety. By changing these parameters, much faster transport times can be achieved.

                            Laser-driven ion acceleration produces particle bunches of unprecedented density. In a secondary target that 
                            is close enough to the laser acceleration source, this leads to a nuclear-interaction-rich scenario. However, this 
                            environment is not background free and hinders a direct detection of the processes of interest. In combination 
                            with a gas transport system, we achieved to transfer the reaction products to a safe location for typical HPGe 
                            detection, more than 10 m away from the point of laser interaction. Tis allowed for high-detection sensitivity 
                            and nearly background-free γ spectroscopy while mitigating the interference of the strong EMP.
                              High-fux proton pulses of sub-nanosecond down to picosecond duration provide an opportunity to study 
                            nuclear reactions in a plasma-like environment. For example, this pulsed-beam regime could cause additional 
                            Coulomb excitations of the target material by the impinging protons within the pulse duration, similar to the 
                            low-lying states’ coupling efects in highly-charged states heavy-ion reactions. Efects on the cross-sections 
                            from varying excited state populations due to the plasma environment will be of interest in future experiments.

                            Fission  in  HED  environment.  For fssionable nuclei embedded in a HED environment, the plasma 
                            interaction is expected to afect “transition” states and alter the fssion probability. Te initial studies involve 
                            measurements of the isotope distributions of fssion fragments identifed from the observation of characteristic 
                            γ-rays. In the nuclear fssion process, a heavy nucleus typically separates into energetic fssion fragments with 
                            diferent masses sharing a total kinetic energy gain of approximately 200 MeV22, 23. Details of the induced fssion 
                            process over a wide range of projectile species and energies are still not well understood for many fssionable 
                            nuclei. Furthermore, a fully microscopic theory of fssion describing experimental data is still to be developed. 
                            Accurate measurements of cross-sections as well as new techniques to measure short-lived fssion fragments 
                            will provide new insight into the nucleon-nucleus interaction. In particular, information on the properties and 
                            efects of highly excited nuclei, e.g., level densities and fssion barriers, can be gained.
                              Neutron-induced fssion experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) have demonstrated the capability 
                            to rapidly collect and detect short-lived gaseous fssion fragment isotopes for the frst time, following an 
                            approximately 80 ps-long pulse of nearly 1016 14−MeV neutrons into 4π from a burning deuterium-tritium 
                            fusion plasma­ 23. Te neutron-induced fssion at NIF, and the present experiment at PHELIX, demonstrate fssion 
                            studies in a new time-domain amid plasma environments.
                              Fission research still is intensively pursued. A particular interest involving astrophysical HED environments 
                            now is driven by energy research, e.g., novel nuclear reactor ­schemes24, advanced nuclear astrophysics, and 
                            cosmogenic nucleosynthesis (e.g., r-processes)25. Te long history of fssion research and the renewed interest

                                    reveal that there are many open and new questions regarding fssion in HED environments. Te detection of 
                                    plasma efects on nuclear reactions, for example, its infuence on the nuclear fssion process’s mechanisms, is a 
                                    long-term focus at HED facilities. Since the discovery of fssion in the 1930s, extensive data and literature on 
                                    fssion have been ­published19, 22, 26. Te nuclear fssion is treated within the macroscopic-microscopic nuclear 
                                    models. Here, the macroscopic part is a charged liquid drop described by the standard formula for nuclear 
                                    ground state energies: E = EVol + ESurf + ECoul + EPauli . Te terms correspond to efects arising from the nuclear 
                                    volume, the surface area, Coulomb repulsion, and the Pauli exclusion principle (asymmetry energy), respectively. 
                                    Te microscopic corrections, shell efects (utilizing the Nilsson model), and the pairing interaction, are taken 
                                    into account­ 22 as well as, most recently, fragment ­formation27. Tis led to a satisfactory description of the fssion 
                                    barrier with an appropriate height as well as oscillation (“hump structure”) of the potential energy barrier for 
                                    actinide nuclei as a function of nucleus deformation­ 26.
                                      Motivated through new nuclear astrophysical observations, recent research on macroscopic-microscopic 
                                    nuclear models aimed to improve the understanding of fssion, the fssion barriers, and dynamic aspects of fssion 
                                    in HED environments­ 25. Te heavy element nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers involving fssion and fssion 
                                    recycling are examples. For “multiple-hump” actinide fssion barrier structures, the second potential minimum 
                                    has been extensively investigated in fssion isomer studies. Te existence of a third potential minimum has 
                                    recently been established for even-even uranium nuclei (as well as an odd isotope). Te thin outer barriers result 
                                    in shorter fssion lifetimes than those from collectively excited ­states25. Te detailed studies involve transmission 
                                    resonance spectroscopy, where the prompt fssion cross-section is measured. Te cross-section exhibits resonance 
                                    enhancements at certain excitation energies because the energies of the collective states in the frst well coincide 
                                    with those of the vibrational states in the second or third well. Te verifcation of a third well led to an agreement 
                                    between measured cross-sections and model calculations with appropriate assumptions for the multiple-hump 
                                    structure and well depths (e.g. 232Torium).

                                    Excited states and nuclear decay.   Te fssion platform being developed will also enable research on the 
                                    efects of a HED environment on other nuclear processes. In a plasma environment, atomic binding energies 
                                    are modifed due to charge state and screening efects, and atomic transitions may interact with excited nuclear 
                                    states, thereby causing nuclear ­transitions7, 28, 29. Terefore, electron-mediated NPIs may cause signifcant 
                                    changes in reaction cross-sections in HED environments such as astrophysical plasmas. However, NPIs remain 
                                    largely unobserved due to the extremely narrow energies of nuclear transitions (Ŵ  ≤ 1 µeV ). Various attempts 
                                    to detect NPIs such as NEEC (Nuclear Excitation by Electron Capture)29, 30 or NEET (Nuclear Excitation 
                                    Electron Transition)31–34 processes are in progress but no consistent experimental evidence has been reported 
                                    yet. In hot stellar environments, the nuclei can reach a thermal population of low-lying nuclear states from 
                                    ­photoexcitation35, 36, NEEC, NEET, and inelastic electron scattering in the dense stellar plasma. Since the nuclear 
                                    reaction cross-sections dramatically depend on the spin-parities of the involved quantum states and the reaction 
                                    Q-value, studies of nuclear reactions in hot plasma environments are essential. Te relevance of NPI processes to 
                                    the production of post-capture nuclei is due to a competition between the short lifetimes of highly-excited states 
                                    versus a large number of nuclear transitions available, and high electron and photon fux.

                                    determined by s- and r-processes in supernovae and neutron-star mergers motivates laboratory astrophysics 
                                    studies. Te s-process, in which the time interval between neutron-captures is longer than the average β-
                                    decay lifetime, proceeds through nuclides along the valley of stability with an isotopic abundance inversely 
                                    proportional to neutron-capture rates. Te s-process is sensitive to nuclear shell closures at which the neutron 
                                    capture probabilities abruptly change. Te work of the s-process is seen in the measured solar element 
                                    abundance pattern as sharp peaks at Sr (N = 50), Ba (N = 82) and Pb (N = 126). Te faster r-process occurs in 
                                                                                             −

                                    small so that the rate of capture is balanced by the photodisintegration by ambient black-body photons. Just as 
                                    in the s-process, the neutron capture rates signifcantly change at nuclear closures, leading to so-called “waiting 
                                    points”. Afer some time, β-decay occurs, and the capture process starts again. Te r-process is terminated by 
                                    reaching the nuclei that undergo fssion, thereby fuelling the r-process by neutrons from fssion and moving the 
                                    abundance pattern to mid-Z nuclei. When the neutron fux ceases, radioactive products decay back to the valley 
                                    of stability (low-mass side of s-process peaks), and the resulting, broader than in s-process, peaks in the mass 
                                    distribution are identifers for the r-process. Te path of r-process fow is through neutron-rich nuclei far from 
                                    the valley of stability through nuclei with binding energies of about 1 to 4 MeV . At this stage, recycling fssion 
                                    may come into play: heavy elements produced by the r-process can undergo fssion, enhancing the population 
                                    of neutron-rich lower-Z elements. Te r-process abundances are determined from solar abundances minus 
                                    s-process contributions. Tus, uncertainties persist in the elemental abundances produced by the r-process.
                                      Substantial experimental and theoretical eforts are proposed and in progress for upcoming new laser 
                                    facilities (e. g. ELI, ARC) and ion beam facilities (e.g. FAIR) to improve the database and theoretical modeling 
                                    to understand astrophysical data. Concrete experiments are planned at ELI­ 10, 38 to demonstrate the production 
                                    of neutron-rich nuclei at the N = 126 waiting point with lasers. We believe that the method presented here is 
                                    ideally suited to detect such products.
                                      In the future, we plan on extending our method to investigate proton-induced reactions of astrophysical 
                                    importance. Here unprecedented proton intensities might allow us to address reactions with tiny cross-sections 
                                    that are presently inaccessible at dedicated underground accelerators. For instance, (p,γ ), (p,n), and (p,α )  reactions 
                                    can be studied simultaneously. However, this might require to perform the laser experiment underground as

                            well. Furthermore, owing to the very short duration of the laser pulse, application of time-of-fight techniques 
                            will be pursued to enable energy-resolved measurements.
                            Experimental method
                            A schematic diagram for the experimental setup at the GSI PHELIX facility is depicted in Fig. 1. Te setup 
                            includes the laser-driven proton source and the uranium target container inside the PHELIX target chamber and 
                            the fssion isotope collection flter directly in front of the γ-detector outside the target chamber.

                            Laser‑driven proton source and laser setup for TNSA.    An extensive work has taken place in the last 
                            two decades on the generation of protons with lasers, afer the pioneering work done at the Nova-Petawatt laser 
                            ­facility1. Since then, the developments have followed two main directions, the frst one exploring theoretically 
                            and experimentally the various mechanisms underlying laser-driven proton acceleration, with the aim to 
                            generate highly-energetic and mono-energetic proton beams in the energy range of 0.1–1 GeV, and the second 
                            one is optimizing the proton sources for ­applications39.
                              As far as laser-driven proton acceleration is concerned, the high-energy sub-picosecond PHELIX system, 
                            which is based on a neodymium-doped-glass chain of amplifying modules, has distinct advantages over other 
                            short-pulse lasers. First, the laser energy and long interaction times of sub-picosecond lasers enable reaching 
                            the highest proton yields as a consequence of the combined efects of the energy and high conversion efciency 
                            demonstrated with this type of laser­ 40. Second, some preliminary work has been done at PHELIX, as in the 
                            framework of the LIGHT ­project41, to condition laser-generated protons for applications, and this knowledge lays 
                            the basis for further work. Previous fndings have shown two optimal interaction conditions for the generation of 
                            stable and reliable protons beams. Te frst confguration, used in the LIGHT project, deals with relatively thick 
                            (several-micrometers) foils, irradiated with a laser pulse exhibiting a moderate nanosecond pedestal. In this case, 
                            the nanosecond pedestal creates a pre-plasma at the surface of the interaction foil that fosters improved light 
                            absorption, and therefore a more efcient proton generation. Te acceleration takes place in the TNSA regime, 
                            and the target thickness helps with the proton beam homogeneity. In the second confguration, the laser irradiates 
                            a sub-micrometer or micrometer foil­ 42. To avoid target pre-heating that destroys the foil, the level of the pulse 
                            pedestal is reduced by the use of an ultrafast optical parametric amplifer in the laser­ 43. While the thinner targets 
                            deliver higher proton energies, the drawback comes from a lower laser-energy coupling into the target because 
                            of the thin nanometer-thick interaction volume at the target surface.
                              Optimization of the proton source by directly comparing quantitatively these proton-source geometries has 
                            been conducted. Our fndings show that, for the current PHELIX parameters, a proton source generated by 
                                                                                                                 ◦
                            irradiating 1 µm thick foils with P-polarized laser beams of the highest temporal contrast under 45  incidence 
                            is the best trade-of44. Afer the initial setup and test, the source delivered reliably, on every shot, TNSA proton 
                            beams with 1012 protons of energy higher than 15 MeV and with cut-of energy around 70 MeV . In comparison 
                            to standard experiments, the pulse profle of PHELIX was stabilized using an acousto-optic programmable 
                            dispersive flter (Fastlite, France) and the pulse profle (spectrum and phase) adjusted daily directly at the 
                            interaction point. A measured proton spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.

                            Experimental  setup  for  proton‑induced  fssion.   Te PHELIX target chamber contains the laser 
                            transport and focusing mirrors and diagnostics, as well as the target holder for the proton production. Te setup 
                            is shown in Fig. 1. A compact target container, holding the uranium target foils, is positioned at a distance of 4 cm 
                            from the laser acceleration source. Te proton bunch enters and leaves the uranium target container through 
                            15-µm-thick titanium windows. A stack of three radiochromic flms (RCFs) is placed in front of the container to 
                            obtain a spatial diagnostic of the proton beam. On the backside, a stack of eleven RCFs is mounted, to diagnose 
                            the protons afer they pass through the uranium targets. Te sensitivity of these flms was calibrated at a proton 
                                                                                               −
                            accelerator. While the PHELIX target chamber is operated at a vacuum of 10 5 mbar , the target container is 
                                                                                              −
                            connected to the gas transport system with a constant gas fow of 500 cm3 min 1 at a pressure of approximately 
                            1 bar. Te container has a length of 60 mm and a diameter of 40 mm . Two uranium target foils with a size of 
                           16 mm  ×  19 mm and a thickness of 15 µm are mounted between two metal frames of size 25 mm × 20 mm , 
                            with a 10-mm opening. Due to their fssion energy, the fragments are emitted from a thin layer at the front and 
                            back of the target material. To increase the fssion fragment production yield, two uranium foils were used with 
                            a distance of 30 mm between them, equivalent to the approximate stopping distance of the fragments. Fission 
                            fragments are stopped in the gas and transported through a polytetrafuoroethylene (PTFE) tube with an inner 
                            diameter of 4 mm , over a distance of 12 m to be collected in a carbon flter at room temperature, in front of an 
                            HPGe detector system. Tis method is ofen practiced for nuclear chemistry ­experiments45, 46 but not adapted 
                            so far together with laser acceleration. Te transport distance of several meters is crucial in this case in order to 
                            reduce EMP-induced background at the HPGe detector to an acceptable level.
                              In the experiment, helium, nitrogen, neon, and argon were used as a transport gas. Depending on the gas, the 
                            stopping power and the background in the spectrum changed, caused by the activation of the carrier gas. Te 
                            best results were achieved with a mixture of helium and argon with a mass fow ratio of 1:1.
                              Te carbon flter consists of a PTFE tube flled with carbon grains with 20–40 µm mesh held in place on 
                            both sides by quartz wool. Te capture efciency for rare heavy gases was tested before the main experiment 
                            with 219 Rn from an 227 Ac source. By comparison of the activity retained in the flter to the activity in a second 
                            identical flter, a capture rate of (99.29 ± 0.15)% was found. For the detection an N-type HPGe detector with 
                            electric cooling was used. Te recorded spectra were stored at certain time intervals in order to obtain the 
                            time-dependent behavior of the spectrum. Even at a distance of 12 m from the laser target, the detector and its 
                            electronics had to be shielded. In addition to a metallic cover, a thin, fexible shielding of polyamide spun-bond

                                          feece, which is internally metal-coated, was used. It ofers damping of around 100 dB over a wide spectral range 
                                          of electromagnetic radiation. Te flter and the detector head were enclosed with lead shielding to minimize 
                                          the γ-ray spectrum background in the relevant energy range. Te collected fssion products are identifed on 
                                          the basis of the observed γ-rays. Te most short-lived isotope observed had a lifetime of 39 seconds, due to the 
                                          transport time.
                                             Tis transport time is given by the volume of the PTFE tube and the mass fow in the gas system. In the given 
                                          setup, it is approximately 18 s . A transport time of around one second can be achieved by using a slightly higher 
                                          pressure in combination with a stronger vacuum pump at the exhaust. Te restriction of the present experiment 
                                          to volatile elements can also be overcome by adding reactive gas or aerosols or a combination of both. For future 
                                          experiments, it will be possible to use more advanced detection ­systems47, which will allow the detection of 
                                          electrons and photons and registration of coincidences.
