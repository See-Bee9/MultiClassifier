 Abstract:                                 Background
                                           Understanding the structure and drivers of gut microbiota remains a major ecological
                                           endeavour. Recent studies have shown that several factors including diet, lifestyle and
                                           geography may substantially shape the human gut microbiota. However, most of these
                                           studies have focused on the more abundant bacterial component and comparatively
                                           less is known regarding fungi in the human gut. This knowledge deficit is especially
                                           true for rural and urban African populations. Therefore, we assessed the structure and
                                           drivers of rural and urban gut mycobiota. 
                                           Results
                                           Our participants (n=100) were balanced by geography and sex. The mycobiota of
                                           these geographically separated cohorts was characterized using amplicon analysis of
                                           the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) gene. We further assessed biomarker species
                                           specific to rural and urban cohorts. In addition to phyla which have been shown to be
                                           ubiquitous constituents of gut microbiota, Pichia were key constituents of the
                                           mycobiota. We found that several factors including geographic location and lifestyle
                                           factors such as the smoking status were major drivers of gut mycobiota. Linear
                                           discriminant and the linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis revealed several
                                           distinct urban and rural biomarkers. 
                                           Conclusions
                                           Together, our analysis reveals distinct community structure in urban and rural South
                                           African individuals. Geography and lifestyle related factors were shown to be key
                                           drivers of rural and urban gut microbiota.

 5 
 6 
 7  38   By comparison to prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), eukaryotes are considered part of the rare 
 8 
 9 
10  39   “biosphere” of the gut [1, 2]. Despite their low abundances, fungi play significant roles in host 
11 
12  40   physiology [2-5]. Recent studies have shown that the gut fungal community composition is less 
13 
14 
15  41   stable over time, compared to bacterial communities [4, 6, 7]. These studies suggest that the gut 
16 
17  42   mycobiota is more variable than bacterial communities, and may be influenced substantially by 
18 
19 
20  43   environmental  factors [3,  7]. Despite evidence confirming  the gut  microbiota  is diverse and 
21 
22  44   interacts with the host immune system [3, 8, 9], knowledge regarding the community structure of 
23 
24       healthy human gut mycobiota remains scant. 
25  45 
26 
27 
28  46   Most studies have focused on the potential roles played by the mycobiota in the aetiology of gut 
29 
30  47   diseases [10-12]. These studies have provided crucial insights on the role of the mycobiota as a 
31 
32       potential drivers of immunological  disorders  and  as opportunistic pathogens  in 
33  48 
34 
35  49   immunocompromised hosts [13]. Further, dysbiosis of gut mycobiota has been linked to obesity, 
36 
37  50   colorectal cancer and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs) [12, 14, 15]. Decreased abundances 
38 
39 
40  51   of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and  higher proportions of Candida albicans were  found in  IBD 
41 
42  52   patients compared to healthy controls. A recent study showed that Crohn’s disease-specific gut 
43 
44 
45  53   environments may select for fungi to the detriment of bacteria suggesting disease-specific inter-
46 
47  54   kingdom network alterations in IBD [12]. Yet, despite these beneficial effects, there remains a 
48 
49 
50  55   clear  deficit in  knowledge regarding the precise role played  by  the  gut mycobiota in disease 
51 
52  56   prevention. Relatedly, the  factors  which drive the diversity  and community structure of gut 
53 
54  57   mycobiome remain underexplored. Assessing the influence of environmental factors on the gut 
55 
56 
57  58   mycobiome across a wider cohort of participants is crucial for determining the effects on host-
58 
59  59   microbiota dynamics and health.

 4  60   Several studies  have evaluated the effects  of age [16-18], gender [17], diet [19], diabetes and 
 5 
 6 
 7  61   obesity [15, 20, 21], anorexia nervosa [22], differences across body sites [23, 24] and geographical 
 8 
 9  62   locations [6,  25,  26] on mycobiome composition  and  diversity. Yet,  these studies  are mostly 
10 
11 
12  63   disease centric or focussed on Asian [26] and/or Western populations [6, 7, 19]. To our knowledge, 
13 
14  64   only one study has investigated the gut eukaryotic diversity of African individuals [27]. Although 
15 
16 
    65   these studies improved our understanding of the mycobiome, there may be several confounding 
17 
18 
19  66   factors such as genetic differences. These differences make it difficult to assess, for instance, the 
20 
21  67   effects of living in urban or rural areas on the microbiome. The effects of diet, geographic locality 
22 
23 
24  68   and  lifestyle, on  the  gut  microbiome are  often  assumed  but  rarely  examined.  Where  these 
25 
26  69   relationships are  assessed, the  majority  of  studies  have primarily  focused on the ecologically 
27 
28 
29  70   abundant bacteria [28,  29] with assertions  that  their  patterns  will  likely  hold  for  other  taxa, 
30 
31  71   including mycobiomes.  
32 
33 
34  72   Here, we applied amplicon sequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the rRNA 
35 
36 
37  73   gene on samples collected from individuals living in urban and rural areas in Africa. We provide 
38 
39  74   the  first  insights  regarding  the  drivers  of  mycobiome  community  structure  and  potential 
40 
41 
42  75   biomarkers  specific  to individuals  from urban  and  rural locations. Previous  studies of  the  gut 
43 
44  76   mycobiome have primarily investigated small cohorts with fewer than 20 individuals [25, 30, 31] 
45 
46  77   with very few studies investigating larger cohorts [6, 32]. This study represents the first analysis 
47 
48 
49  78   of the faecal mycobiota in a large cohort of healthy sub-Saharan individuals (100 volunteers). 
50 
51  79   Furthermore,  this  is  the  first  study which compares  the  composition  and  diversity  of  the  gut 
52 
53 
54  80   mycobiome  of  geographically  separated  non-western  individuals with the  same  ethnicity. We 
55 
56  81   further explored potential biomarker taxa in urban and rural individuals and explore how these 
57 
58 
59  82   taxa vary between the two areas. Using extensive predictor variables collected from participants, 
60 
61 
62                                                                                    5

16  87   We assessed the faecal mycobiota of South African adults living in rural (n=50) and urban regions 
17 
18 
19  88   (n= 50) by assessing stool samples (see details regarding sample recruitment in Methods). We 
20 
21  89   recruited an equal number of male and female volunteers across two villages in the Limpopo region 
22 
23 
    90   of South Africa, which is located roughly 500km from the urban site (Pretoria) (Figure 1a). To 
24 
25 
26  91   gain  insights  regarding predictive variables  which  may  shape  the  gut  microbiome,  detailed 
27 
28  92   questionnaires were distributed to all volunteers. The volunteers from Ha-Ravele and Tshikombani 
29 
30 
31  93   villages (population size of roughly 200,000, representing the rural participants) were on average 
32 
33  94   24 years (mean ± 6.3). Volunteers from Pretoria (total population of approximately 2.1 million) 
34 
35 
36  95   were on average 31 years (mean ± 9.1). The BMI of all participants was above 26.45, resulting in 
37 
38  96   a cohort of individuals classified as obese, less than 15.9% of participants were smokers. 
39 
40 
41  97   Amplicon sequence data from 95 volunteers (samples from 5 rural volunteers were excluded due 
42 
43 
44  98   to  low  quality  reads) generated 5,936,454  raw  reads. A total of 5,414,023 fungal  reads were 
45 
46  99   retained after sequence filtering and chimera removal. Of these, 1,636,180 reads were assigned to 
47 
48 
49 100   OTUs and these were further clustered into 1,911 OTUs using a 97% cut-off. A higher proportion 
50 
51 101   of fungal OTUs were unique to location with urban and rural samples accounting for 47.9% and 
52 
53 102   45.3% of reads, respectively (Supplemental Figure 1a). 
54 
55 
56 
57 103   After  random  subsampling  to  the  lowest  read  count,  155  OTUs  were  excluded from  further 
58 
59 104   analyses. The resulting accumulation curves showed reasonable sequence saturation, at a regional

15 109   Two ubiquitous fungal phyla in urban and rural locations 
16 
17 
18 110   Overall, four distinct fungal phyla were detected in urban and rural gut mycobiomes, based on 
19 
20 111   sequences  with relative abundances above 0.1% (Figure 1c). The majority of sequences were 
21 
22 
23 112   assigned to members of the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, that constituted 80.7% and 
24 
25 113   6.1% of the total relative abundance, respectively. Unknown sequences constituted 12.9% of the 
26 
27 
28 114   fungal  mycobiome. In total, 13  distinct  fungal  classes  were  identified with Saccharomycetes 
29 
30 115   constituting  the  majority  of  sequences (50.1%)  followed  by Dothideomycetes (20.3%), 
31 
32       Eurotiomycetes (4.8%)  and Sordariomycetes (3.9%). Unknown fungal genera dominated  our 
33 116 
34 
35 117   cohort  (18.4%),  followed  by Pichia (17.6%) Candida (17.1%) and Cladosporium (5.9%). 
36 
37 118   However, no significant difference was found between taxa abundance at the class level for the 
38 
39 
40 119   gut mycobiota of rural  and  urban participants (W  =  1054, p-value  =  0.5992).  The  difference 
41 
42 120   between  the  gut mycobiota of  rural  and  urban  individuals,  across  the  two  locations,  was  not 
43 
44 
45 121   statistically significant (Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared = 2.9875, df = 3, p-value = 0.3936). 
46 
47 
48 122   To  assess the  degree  of  uniqueness  of  a given  sample  in  relation  to  the  overall  community 
49 
50 123   composition, we assessed the local contribution to beta diversity (LCTBD). We found that samples 
51 
52 
53 124   from urban volunteers contributed a greater fraction of the overall community diversity (p-Value 
54 
55 125   < 0.05). Samples with high local contribution to beta diversity (LCTBD) had a high abundance of 
56 
57 
58 126   Basidiomycota and other unknown taxa. In contrast,  only two samples  from  the rural  location 
59 
60 127   contributed to overall community diversity (Supplemental Figure 1c).

 8 
 9 
10 130   visualized  in  an  NMDS  plot  (Figure 2a).  Urban  and  rural  samples formed distict clusters 
11 
12 131   [PERMANOVA  (R2  =  0.070; p-Value  =  0.0001),  ANOSIM  (R  =  0.43, p-Value  =  0.001)  and

14                 2
15 132   ADONIS (R  = 0.07034 p-Value = 0.0001)]. However, male and female samples did not cluster 
16 
17 133   separately. Pairwise analysis of permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) 
18 
19 
20 134   showed that there was no significant difference between female vs male urban, and female vs male 
21 
22 135   rural individuals (R2 = 0.018; R2 = 0.023; respectively and p-Value > 0.4 for both). However, there 
23 
24       was a significant difference between the gut mycobiota of urban versus rural female and male 
25 136 
26 
27 137   participants (R2 < 0.074 for all; p-Value = 0.001 for all).

31 
32 
33 139   Redundancy analysis (RDA) was performed to determine which predictor variables significantly 
34 
35 
36 140   explained the variation in fungal community composition (Figure 2b). Four predictive variables 
37 
38 141   were significant  (r2 >  0.2; p-Value  <  0.05) drivers  of community  composition  and  structure. 
39 
40 
41 142   Predictive variables included; breastfeeding, smoking, mode of birth and location; all of which 
42 
43 143   significantly influenced the fungal community composition. 
44 
45 
46 144   We conducted correlation analyses to explore the relationships among dominant gut species. Our 
47 
48 
49 145   results  showed a few highly positive  correlations  in  the  rural  cohort: between Mucor and 
50 
51 146   Dipodascus, Mucor and Naganishia, Clavispora and Lentendrea, and between Udeniomyces and 
52 
53 147   Lentendrea (Figure 4a).  Whereas,  the  strongest  negative  correlation  was found between 
54 
55 
56 148   Dipodascus with Trichoderma, Dipodascus with Ascotricha and Dipodascus with Chalastospora.

19 
20 156   (Figure 3a). OTU level analysis uncovered 14 urban-associated species from 10 genera. Whereas, 
21 
22 
23 157   17 rural-associated  species  from 11 genera,  were  detected  as  possible  biomarkers. The  most 
24 
25 158   abundant rural-associated  biomarker  genera  were Hypopichia and Dipodascus, with  species 
26 
27 
28 159   Hypopichia burtonii and Dipodascus geotrichum being the most ubundant (Figure 3b). Whereas, 
29 
30 160   the  urban-associated  biomarkers  were  dominated  by the  class Tremellomycetes and genera 
31 
32       Dekkera and Hannaella.  Whereas,  species Dekkera  bruxellensis  and  Hannaella  sinensis 
33 161 
34 
35 162   dominated the urban-associated biomarkers.

38 163   Discussion 
39 
40 
41 164   The results from this study suggest that the gut mycobiome of the South African population is 
42 
43 
44 165   structured by  geography  and  lifestyle.  This finding is supported by  the clustering of  a  large 
45 
46 166   proportion of the fungal OTU’s into discrete rural and urban groups within the Venn diagram. 
47 
48 
49 167   Only a small percentage of OTUs were shared between the two populations, which may suggest 
50 
51 168   that factors such as the environment, age and diet may play a role in shaping the differences in 
52 
53 169   OTU clustering. These results were further corroborated by two distinct clusters, consistent with 
54 
55 
56 170   rural and urban locality.

 4 171   Several studies have investigated the healthy human mycobiome [6, 7, 19, 25, 30, 34]. In these 
 5 
 6 
 7 172   studies, geography was  not considered as a potential factor structuring the gut mycobiota. For 
 8 
 9 173   instance, Nash et al. (2017) found no association between host phenotypic characteristics with 
10 
11 
12 174   mycobiome  profile.  This  study suggests  that  diet,  the  environment,  diurnal  cycles,  and  host 
13 
14 175   genetics may substantially influence the human gut mycobiome. However, the finding that the 
15 
16 
   176   majority  of  the variation could  not  be  explained  by  their metadata does  suggest  that other 
17 
18 
19 177   environmental factors, such as geography, may contribute to structuring the human microbiome 
20 
21 178   [6]. 
22 
23 
24       Our study provides the first results showing the importance of geography in African populations. 
25 179 
26 
27 180   Geographic  locality  may  be  associated with different environmental  factors,  such  as  different 
28 
29 181   climatic regimes, which may effect structural changes in the mycobiota. For example, climate 
30 
31 
32 182   significantly influences vegetation and farming practices and leads to region specific diets. These 
33 
34 183   region-specific diets may ultimately influence the gut mycobiota. This is a reasonable prediction 
35 
36 
37 184   given previous findings showing that fungi have climate dependent biogeographic patterns [35, 
38 
39 185   36]. These patterns are likely to determine the type of fungi individuals may be exposed to, which 
40 
41 
42 186   may in turn impact the colonization of fungi in the human gut. The most abundant rural-associated 
43 
44 187   biomarker  species  found  in  this  study, Dipodascus  geotrichum, is  ubiquitous  in  nature [37] 
45 
46 188   whereas, Hypopichia burtonii is commonly isolated from corn, wheat, and rice [38]. The urban-
47 
48 
49 189   associated biomarkers were dominated by the species Dekkera bruxellensis, which are commonly 
50 
51 190   isolated from fermented food such as wine, beer, feta cheese and sour dough [39-41]. In contrast, 
52 
53 
54 191   Hannaella sinensis is commonly isolated from plants and soil [42, 43]. The staple diet of the rural 
55 
56 192   South African population primarily consists of a corn-based porridge (called ‘pap’). It is therefore 
57 
58 
59 193   not uncommon for a fungal species commonly isolated from corn to be a dominant biomarker for 
60 
61 
62                                                                                   10

 4 194   the  rural  population.  Conversely,  the  urban  population  diet was more  diverse and included 
 5 
 6 
 7 195   fermented foods such as wine, sour dough bread and feta cheese, which are commonly available 
 8 
 9 196   in supermarkets. Thus, the species Dekkera bruxellensis was identified as a dominant biomarker 
10 
11 
12 197   in the urban population. 
13 
14 
15 198   In  addition  to geographic  location, we  found  that smoking, mode  of  birth and breastfeeding 
16 
17 199   significantly influenced gut  fungal  communities. Several studies have previously reported that 
18 
19 
20 200   these  factors may significantly  influence the initial  colonization,  subsequent  composition  and 
21 
22 201   structure of bacterial members of the human gut microbiome [28, 44-46]. Suhr et al. (2016) and 
23 
24       Hallen-Adams et al. (2017) investigated the gut mycobiome of two cohorts that were exclusively 
25 202 
26 
27 203   on  a  vegetarian or  a western  diet.  These studies  found  that the distribution  of  fungi  differed 
28 
29 204   considerably between the two cohorts [7, 47]. Plant-associated Fusarium, Malassezia, Penicillium 
30 
31 
32 205   and Aspergillus species were  detected at higher  abundances within  the  vegetarian  cohort, 
33 
34 206   compared  to  the cohort  on a conventional  diet. The  finding that smoking  affected  fungal 
35 
36 
37 207   community composition and structure is supported by several studies  [48-50]. The approximately 
38 
39 208   4000 chemical compounds produced by cigarettes have been shown to alter the composition of the 
40 
41 
42 209   gut microbiome [48, 50-53].  The reported increase of Clostridia induced by smoking in murine 
43 
44 210   models has also been indirectly  confirmed  in  humans  where  an  increased  rate  of C.  difficile 
45 
46 211   infection was greater in former and current smokers compared to never smokers [52]. Moreover, 
47 
48 
49 212   the abundance of the fungus Candida tropicalis has also been reported to be significantly higher 
50 
51 213   in C.  difficile infection patients  compared  to healthy  individuals.  [54]. The  abundance  of C. 
52 
53 
54 214   tropicalis has also been detected to be positively correlated with levels of anti-Saccharomyces 
55 
56 215   cerevisiae antibodies  (ASCA) [54]. In  our  study C.  tropicalis was  detected  to  be  higher  in 
57 
58 
59 216   individuals who smoke compared to non-smokers whereas, the inverse was true for S. cerevisiae. 
60 
61 
62                                                                                   11 
63        
64 
65 
 1 
 2 
 3 
 4 217   These findings may confirm the antagonistic association between the species C. tropicalis and S. 
 5 
 6 
 7 218   cerevisiae, as previously reported by Hoarau et al., (2016). 
 8 
 9 
10 219   Most studies have identified the genera Candida, Saccharomyces, Malassezia and Aspergillus as 
11 
12 220   the three most abundant in the gut of healthy individuals [6, 25, 32]. To the best of our knowledge, 
13 
14 
15 221   our study is the first to report Pichia as one of the top four most abundant genera in the human gut 
16 
17 222   mycobiome. This may be due to several factors including differences in cohort characteristics (e.g., 
18 
19 
20 223   geographical location, diet, genetic predisposition and climate). Pichia have been identified as 
21 
22 224   both constituent members of the human oral [55, 56] and gut microbiome [34]. Mukherjee detected 
23 
24       a 1:1 abundance ratio in the oral mycobiome of individuals when Candida and Pichia were present 
25 225 
26 
27 226   together [56]. Pichia was also observed to have an antagonistic effect against Candida, Fusarium 
28 
29 227   and Aspergillus.  
30 
31 
32       The yeast  genera, Pichia,  Candida and Cladosporium, dominated the  South  African  gut 
33 228 
34 
35 229   mycobiome.   Our  findings agree  with previous  studies  which show  that members  of  the 
36 
37 230   Aspergillus, Candida, Debaryomyces, Malassezia, Penicillium, Pichia, and Saccharomyces genera 
38 
39 
40 231   were the  most  recurrent  and/or  dominant  fungal  genera [34,  47,  57]. In  contrast  to  previous 
41 
42 232   findings, our data indicate higher relative abundances of Cladosporium, detection of Mucor and 
43 
44 
45 233   the absence or low abundance of genera such as Cyberlindnera, and Galactomyces [6, 19, 58]. 
46 
47 234   Previous studies found that the gut mycobiome of a cohort from Houston, Texas, was dominated 
48 
49 
50 235   by Saccharomyces,  Malassezia and Candida [6]. By  contrast,  the  genus Malassezia was  not 
51 
52 236   detected in the gut mycobiome of a Pennsylvania cohort, which was instead dominated by the 
53 
54 237   genera Saccharomyces and Candida [19]. Differences in study methodologies may be a source of 
55 
56 
57 238   these conflicting findings [6]. One study amplified the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region 
58 
59 239   of the fungal rRNA gene [6], and the second amplified the ITS1 region [19]. Studies similar to the 
60 
61 
62                                                                                   12

 4 240   work by Gardes et al. (1993) and White et al. (1990), where ITS1F and ITS2 primer sets were used 
 5 
 6 
 7 241   to amplify the ITS2 region, did not detect Malassezia [59, 60]. The second reason for the observed 
 8 
 9 242   differences  has  been  attributed  to differences  in  cohort  characteristics,  such  as  diet and/or 
10 
11 
12 243   geographical location. Strati (2016) and Raimondi’s (2019) investigating cohorts in Italy, detected 
13 
14 244   same dominant fungal genera [58, 61], and the investigation of cohorts in two different states in 
15 
16 
   245   the USA observed different results [6, 46]. We used ITS1 and ITS4 in this study and found that 
17 
18 
19 246   the genera Pichia, Candida and Cladosporium dominated the urban cohort, whereas genera Pichia, 
20 
21 247   Candida and Aspergillus dominated the rural cohort. The dominant taxa identified in urban and 
22 
23 
24 248   rural  locations  further support our assertion that geographic location plays a major role in  the 
25 
26 249   observed differences. 
27 
28 
29 250   Candida albicans was the most dominant taxa n our cohort and is frequently reported as the most 
30 
31 
32 251   abundant Candida species in both diseased [62] and healthy individuals [63]. Candida spp. not 
33 
34 252   only colonize the gut [19, 34] but several other body sites, including the oral cavity [55, 64], vagina 
35 
36 
37 253   [65], and skin [66, 67]. However, Candida are autochthonous to the mammalian digestive tract 
38 
39 254   and species including Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata may grow 
40 
41 
42 255   and colonize at 37˚C [7].  A review of the literature suggest that C. albicans carriage in healthy 
43 
44 256   individuals ranges from 30–60% [68] and that living mammals are considered a niche for these 
45 
46 257   species as they are not found in significant concentrations in soil, food or air [69, 70]. Raimondi 
47 
48 
49 258   et  al., (2019) reported  that C.  albicans was frequently  detected  and  dominated  the  cultivable 
50 
51 259   mycobiota of different faecal samples [61].

55 
56 
57 
58 261   This study provides the first insight into the importance of geography and lifestyle factors on the 
59 
60 262   gut mycobiome in rural  and urban locations in Africa. We found that fungi in the gut display 
61 
62                                                                                   13

 3 
 4 263   distinct patterns consistent  with  geographic locality. Redundancy analysis  showed that several 
 5 
 6 
 7 264   lifestyle factors were major drivers explaining the distinct community structure. The results of 
 8 
 9 265   biomarker  analysis revealed several ecologically  important fungal taxa, which were unique  to 
10 
11 
12 266   individuals  from urban  and  rural  areas.  These  results  have  significant  health  implications, 
13 
14 267   particularly for immunocompromised individuals living in rural and urban locations. Such findings 
15 
16 
   268   provide a valid basis for the development of novel therapeutics or preventative measures reliant 
17 
18 
19 269   on modulating the gut mycobiome.

31 273   we recruited individuals following traditional diets, with generally low levels of processed foods. 
32 
33 274   Urban cohorts reported mixed diets and increased consumption of processed foods. Volunteers 
34 
35 
36 275   from the Ha-Ravele and Tshikombani villages located in the Vhembe District of the Limpopo 
37 
38 276   Province comprised the rural cohort. Both villages  are  approximately  391  km  and  439  km, 
39 
40 
41 277   respectively, from the closest city (Pretoria). This city, in the Gauteng province of South Africa, 
42 
43 278   served as the urban sampling area (Figure 1a). In total, 100 stool samples were collected from 
44 
45 279   healthy volunteers. These samples were equally divided between gender and locality [i.e. rural (25 
46 
47 
48 280   males  and  25  females)  and  urban  (25  males  and  25  females)]. Self-stool  collection  kits  were 
49 
50 281   provided to all volunteers (Easy Sampler® Stool collection Kit, Hounisen Lab Equipment A/S, 
51 
52 
53 282   Skanderborg, Denmark).

15 288   DNA extraction 
16 
17 289   DNA was isolated using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO BIO Laboratories Inc., Carlsbad, 
18 
19 
20 290   CA) following the manufacturer’s specifications with minor modifications. Briefly, approximately 
21 
22 291   0.25g of stool sample was transferred into the Power-Bead tubes using a sterile disposable wooden 
23 
24       spatula (Lasec Laboratories, RSA). The sample was homogenized by gently vortexing the tubes 
25 292 
26 
27 293   for 10 s before adding 60 µL of the lysis buffer. This was then incubated for 30 min. at 55°C prior 
28 
29 294   to centrifugation at room temperature for 30 s at 10,000 x g. The supernatant from this step was 
30 
31 
32 295   transferred to sterile 2 mL tubes and 250 µL of inhibitor removal reagent was added to this.  The 
33 
34 296   samples were incubated on ice for 5 min., thereafter approximately 1.2 mL of binding buffer was 
35 
36 
37 297   added. Next, 70% ethanol (500 µL) was added and the contents precipitated by centrifugation at 
38 
39 298   room  temperature  for  60  s  at  10,000  x g.  The  DNA  was  eluted  with  100 µL  filter-sterilised 
40 
41 
42 299   autoclaved Millipore water and quantified using the NanoDrop™ 2000/2000c Spectrophotometer 
43 
44 300   (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The quality of isolated DNA was confirmed by agarose 
45 
46 301   gel electrophoresis, on 1% (w/v) agarose gel in 1 X TAE buffer (0.2% [w/v] Tris, 0.5% [v/v] acetic 
47 
48 
49 302   acid,  1%  [v/v]  5  M  EDTA  [pH  8])  at  90  Volts  for  45 min. in  a  BioRad  Sub-Cell®  GT  gel 
50 
51 303   electrophoresis system with gel red visualising agent. The gel was visualised using the BioRad Gel

12 308   TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3‘) and the HotStarTaq Plus Master Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 
13 
14 309   Amplicons from different samples were pooled to equimolar concentrations and purified of short 
15 
16 
   310   fragments using Agencourt Ampure beads (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation, USA). Paired-end 
17 
18 
19 311   2 x 250bp sequencing was performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, 
20 
21 312   CA, USA) at Mr DNA (Shallowater, TX 79363). 
22 
23 
24       The resultant data were analysed using the Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME2) 
25 313 
26 
27 314   software  version  2018.8.0 [71]. Demultiplexed  sequences were  assessed  for  quality  and  those 
28 
29 315   shorter than 200 bp, with quality scores below 25, containing more than two ambiguous characters 
30 
31 
32 316   or more than one mismatch to the sample-specific barcode or the primer sequences, were excluded 
33 
34 317   from  further downstream  analyses.  Chimeric sequence detection and operation taxonomic unit 
35 
36 
37 318   (OTU)  selection was  performed at 97%  sequence  similarity  using  USEARCH  v11 [72]. 
38 
39 319   Taxonomies were assigned to each OTU using the UNITE (release 7_99) databases for fungi [73]. 
40 
41 
42 320   Singletons  were  excluded,  and  each  sample  was  randomly  subsampled  (rarefied)  to  the  same 
43 
44 321   number of sequences per sample (17 980).  
45 
46 
47 322   Statistical analyses  
48 
49 
50 323   All statistical analyses were performed in R version 3.5.1 using R studio [74, 75]. Alpha diversity 
51 
52 
53 324   indices (observed, Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indices), together with rarefaction curves were 
54 
55 325   calculated and visualized using the R packages “phyloseq” and “ggplot”. First, the Shapiro-Wilk’s 
56 
57 
58 326   test  was  applied  to  determine  data  distribution [76].  Subsequently,  the  unpaired  two-sample 
59 
60 327   Wilcoxon rank sum test [77, 78] was applied to determine significant differences between the 
61 
62                                                                                   16

 7 329   [79, 80]. In these analyses, the rural or urban location was specified as a random factor.  
 8 
 9 
10 330   The R packages “phyloseq” [81] and “microbiomeseq” [82] were used to calculate and visualize 
11 
12 331   relative taxa abundance at phylum and class level. OTU abundance was transformed to relative 
13 
14 
15 332   abundance and taxa with relative abundance less than 0.1% were removed. The Wilcoxon rank 
16 
17 333   sum  test  was  applied  to  determine  significant  differences  between  taxa  in  the  urban  and  rural 
18 
19 
20 334   samples. Whereas, the Kruskal-Wallis test [83] was applied to determine significant differences 
21 
22 335   between taxa in the four sample types.   
23 
24 
25 336   The local contribution to beta diversity (LCBD) was  calculated according to [84]. The LCBD 
26 
27 
28 337   describes  the degree of  uniqueness  of  a  given  sample in  relation  to  the  overall community 
29 
30 338   composition. The taxa abundance was normalized to obtain the proportion of most abundant taxa 
31 
32       per sample. Location was used as the grouping variable and the Hellinger method was used for the 
33 339 
34 
35 340   dissimilarity coefficients calculation.  
36 
37 
38 341   Pairwise similarities among samples were calculated using the Bray–Curtis index of similarity. 
39 
40 
41 342   The resulting matrix was represented visually in a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) 
42 
43 343   plot to observe community structure.  Using the vegan package [85], a permutational multivariate 
44 
45 344   analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) [86] based on 9999 permutations of the data, was performed 
46 
47 
48 345   to test whether differences between sample groupings in the NMDS ordinations were statistically 
49 
50 346   significant. Microbial community similarities and the homogeneity of dispersion between the rural 
51 
52 
53 347   and urban sample groups were tested using the ANOSIM and ADONIS tests, respectively [87, 88]. 
54 
55 
56 348   The effect of the different recorded environmental factors on fungal community composition and 
57 
58 349   structure was determined through redundancy analysis (RDA). First, the OTU-count data were 
59 
60 
61 
62                                                                                   17

 5 
 6 
 7 351   redundancy  axes  was  identified  using  the  envfit  function  from  the  R  package  vegan [85].  To 
 8 
 9 352   measure the relationship of abundant taxa with measured anthropometric factors (age, BMI, height, 
10 
11 
12 353   and  weight),  a  Spearman  correlation  analysis  was  done  and  visualized  in  the  R  package 
13 
14 354   microbiomeseq [82].   
15 
16 
17 355   Fungal-fungal  relationships  were  interrogated  using  SparCC [89]. Correlation was  based  on 
18 
19 
20 356   measuring the linear relationship between log transformed abundances. First, data were filtered to 
21 
22 357   remove OTUs that had less than 2 reads on average. SparCC was used to generate true correlation 
23 
24       coefficients from which pseudo p-values were calculated. The calculate pseudo p-values were false 
25 358 
26 
27 359   discovery rate (FDR) adjusted [90] and the correlation matrix was visualized using the “corrplot” 
28 
29 360   function [91] in R.  
30 
31 
32       Potential biomarker taxa which differed in abundance and occurrence between the two geographic 
33 361 
34 
35 362   groups were detected by linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) [33]. The LEfSe 
36 
37 363   was  calculated  using  the  online  Galaxy  web  application [92] with  the  Huttenhower  lab’s  tool 
38 
39 
40 364   (https://galaxyproject.org/learn/visualization/custom/lefse/). First  the  nonparametric  factorial 
41 
42 365   Kruskal–Wallis sum rank tests (alpha = 0.01) was used to detect differential abundant features (at 
43 
44 
45 366   genera, family, class and phylum level) within the two geographic locations (rural and urban). The 
46 
47 367   phylogenetic consistency was then tested using the pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum tests (alpha = 
48 
49 
50 368   0.01). Finally, the effect size of each differentially abundant feature was estimated using the LDA. 
51 
52 369   The all-against-all classes were compared (most stringent) and a linear discriminant analysis score 
53 
54 370   value of 2.0 was chosen as threshold for discriminative features.
