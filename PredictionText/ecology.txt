                           EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 The Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program (EMAC), funded through the U.S. Department of 
Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Field Office (NNSA/NFO), monitors the 
ecosystem of the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS) and ensures compliance with laws and 
regulations pertaining to NNSS biota. This report summarizes the program’s activities conducted by 
Mission Support and Test Services, LLC (MSTS), during calendar year 2019. Program activities included 
(a) biological surveys at proposed activity sites, (b) desert tortoise compliance, (c) ecosystem monitoring, 
(d) sensitive and protected/regulated plant monitoring, (e) sensitive and protected/regulated animal 
monitoring, and (f) habitat restoration monitoring. During 2019, all applicable laws, regulations, and 
 permit requirements were met, enabling EMAC to achieve its intended goals and objectives. 

 Sensitive and protected/regulated species of the NNSS include 42 plants, 1 mollusk, 2 reptiles, 241 birds, 
 and 23 mammals. These species are protected, regulated, or considered sensitive according to state or 
 federal regulations and natural resource agencies and organizations. The desert tortoise (Gopherus 
 agassizii) is the only species on the NNSS protected under the Endangered Species Act, and is listed as 
 threatened. Biological surveys for the presence of sensitive and protected/regulated species and important 
 biological resources on which they depend were conducted for 33 projects. A total of 141.2 hectares (ha) 
 were surveyed for these projects. The surveyed area included the project area and a buffer area extending 
 10-20 meters (m) beyond the project area. Some of the sensitive and protected/regulated species and 
 important biological resources found during the surveys included bird nesting sites; western red-tailed 
 skink (Plestiodon gilberti rubricaudatus) habitat; predator burrows utilized by desert tortoises; bat sign 
 within abandoned buildings; ungulate sign (pronghorn antelope [Antilocapra americana], feral burro 
 [Equus asinus], feral horse [Equus caballus] and mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus]); two sensitive plant 
 species (Cane Spring Suncup [Camissonia megalantha] and sand cholla [Grusonia pulchella]); yucca 
 plants (Joshua tree [Yucca brevifolia] and Mojave yucca [Yucca schidigera]); singleleaf pinyon (Pinus 
 monophylla); and multiple cactus species. Scientists communicated with ground crews and provided 
 written summary reports to project managers of survey findings and mitigation recommendations 
 when applicable. 

 Twenty-one surveys were completed by biologists within the range of the desert tortoise in 2019. No 
 desert tortoises were observed or reported injured or killed during projects and no desert tortoise habitat 
 was disturbed. All projects that were monitored within tortoise habitat remained within the surveyed 
 project area. 

 There were 66 reported desert tortoise roadside sightings during 2019. Fifty-four of the encountered 
 tortoises were determined to be in harm’s way and moved off the road in accordance with FWS-approved 
 tortoise handling procedures. Amongst the 54 tortoises moved off NNSS roads, one was a juvenile 
 tortoise found with active bird predation wounds on the carapace. The tortoise was alive, taken to a 
 veterinarian and later euthanized for its life-threatening injuries. Two of the roadside sightings were 
 roadkills. One was a juvenile found on a dirt road in Area 5 and the other was an adult found on Jackass 
 Flats Road in Area 22. 

 Juvenile tortoises continued to be monitored as part of a collaborative effort to study survival of 
 translocated animals. After 88 months post-release, 23 of the 60 juveniles were still alive (38.3% survival) 
 which is somewhat higher but similar to an estimated 33% survival in a natural population. There is a 
 much higher survival rate for males (50% [15 of 30]) compared to females (28% [8 of 29]) with most of 
 the mortalities suspected as coyote and kit fox predation. 

 From 1978 to 2019, there has been an average of 10.3 wildland fires per year on the NNSS with an 
 average of about 98.0 ha burned per fire. Two wildland fires were reported on the NNSS in 2019, both of 


                                       v

 which were very small (0.1 acres). They were extinguished by NNSS Fire and Rescue personnel or 
 carefully monitored until they burned out. 

 Wildlife use at nine natural water sources (one well pond, five water troughs, and three radiologically 
 contaminated sumps) was documented using motion-activated cameras. Field surveys for sensitive plants 
 were conducted for black woollypod (Astragalus funereus), Cane Spring suncup, Pahute green gentian 
 (Frasera pahutensis), sanicle biscuitroot (Cymopterus ripleyi var. saniculoides), weasel phacelia 
 (Phacelia mustelina), and rock purpusia (Ivesia arizonica var. saxosa). 

 Surveys of sensitive and protected/regulated animals in 2019 focused on birds, bats, feral horses, mule 
 deer, pronghorn antelope, desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni), and mountain lions (Puma 
 concolor). Additional information is presented about bird mortalities, Migratory Bird Treaty Act 
compliance, nuisance animals and their control, and increasing populations of feral burros. 

A total of 19 dead birds were documented on the NNSS in 2019. Fourteen (4 red-tailed hawks [Buteo 
jamaicensis] and 10 common ravens [Corvus corax]) were electrocuted, one red-tailed hawk was found 
severely injured due to unknown causes and was euthanized, one northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) was 
injured due to unknown causes and died the next day, and three European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) 
were found dead due to entrapment. No golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) deaths were documented. A 
total of 157 poles were retrofitted or reconfigured during 2019. A variety of retrofits were made including 
installing insulator covers and extenders, perch deterrents, conductor wire covers, and fuse covers. Three 
golden eagle sightings were documented during the winter raptor surveys. This is quite a few less than 
last year’s total of 11 golden eagle sightings across all surveys. The red-tailed hawk was the most 
common species detected on both survey routes, comprising nearly two-thirds of all raptor sightings. 
Common ravens were more prevalent on the southern route this year than in Yucca Flat with most of 
them observed near the Mercury Sewage Lagoons. 

Feral horse distribution was similar this year to last year with concentrated activity around Camp 17 Pond 
and Gold Meadows Spring especially during the hot, dry summer months. A total of 57 individuals were 
identified in at least seven different bands with at least six foals and nine juveniles observed. A total of 
119 deer were observed during spotlight surveys, which equates to an average of 19.8 deer per survey 
night. Thirteen marked sheep were documented with camera traps at water sources in the Shoshone 
Mountain, Yucca Mountain, Fortymile Canyon areas. These included eight ewes (six captured in 2016 
and two captured in 2015) and five rams (four captured in 2016 and one captured in 2015). In addition to 
the 13 marked sheep, a minimum of 11 unmarked sheep (four adult ewes, one young ewe, two lambs, 
three adult rams, and one young ram) were also detected at the monitored water sources. Combined, a 
minimum of 24 sheep were documented at monitored water sources on the NNSS in 2019.  

A total of 69 mountain lion images (i.e., photographs or video clips) were taken during 112,428 camera 
hours at 7 of 25 sites sampled. An additional 20,175 images of at least 52 species other than mountain 
lions were also documented. This is the greatest species richness documented using camera traps in a 
given year and the highest number of images per 1000 camera hours by more than three-fold. A minimum 
of five individual mountain lions (adult male and adult female with three subadults) were known to occur 
on the NNSS in 2019.  

Habitat restoration activities conducted in 2019 included visually assessing the vegetation at the U-3ax/bl 
closure cover (CAU 110) and the “92-Acre Site” (CAU 111), overseeing and supporting the revegetation 
of Clean Slate II and Clean Slate III sites on the Tonopah Test Range, and preparing for the revegetation 
of Cell 18 at the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex.

 1.0  INTRODUCTION 

 In accordance with U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Order DOE O 231.1B, “Environment, Safety, and 
Health Reporting,” the Office of the Assistant Manager for Mission and Infrastructure of the 
U.S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Field Office (NNSA/NFO) 
requires ecological monitoring and biological compliance support for activities and programs conducted 
at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS). Mission Support and Test Services, LLC (MSTS) is the 
Management and Operations contractor for the NNSS. MSTS Ecological and Environmental Monitoring 
has implemented the Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program (EMAC) to provide the 
aforementioned biological compliance support and ecological monitoring. EMAC is designed to ensure 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, delineate and define NNSS ecosystems, and provide 
ecological information that can be used to predict and evaluate the potential impacts of proposed projects 
and programs on those ecosystems. During 2019, all applicable laws and regulations were followed, and 
the permit requirements were met, enabling EMAC to achieve its intended goals and objectives. 

This report summarizes the EMAC activities conducted by MSTS during calendar year 2019. For 
purposes of this report, MSTS will be referred to when discussing work accomplished by NNSS 
biologists. Monitoring tasks during 2019 included six program areas: (a) biological surveys, (b) desert 
tortoise compliance, (c) ecosystem monitoring, (d) sensitive and protected/regulated plant monitoring, 
(e) sensitive and protected/regulated animal monitoring, and (f) habitat restoration monitoring. The 
following sections of this report describe work performed under these six program areas.

 2.0  BIOLOGICAL SURVEYS 

 Projects or activities involving land-disturbing activities on the NNSS are reviewed by biologists to 
 determine if 1) sensitive and protected/regulated species are within the project area 2) a biological survey 
 is required to identify sensitive and protected/regulated species within the project area and/or 3) 
 developing mitigation measures to protect impacted species is required. Projects submit their scope of 
 work for review prior to start of work through several different company processes including, but not 
 limited to National Environmental Policy Act checklists, Real Estate Operations Permits (parcels of land 
 with specified activities or facilities designated to remain with that parcel), and/or MSTS documents. 

 Biological surveys are performed at project sites where land-disturbing activities are proposed. The goal 
is to minimize adverse effects of land disturbance on sensitive and protected/regulated plant and animal 
species (Table 2-1), their associated habitat, and other important biological resources. Sensitive species 
are defined as species that are at risk of extinction or serious decline or whose long-term viability has 
been identified as a concern. They include species on the Nevada Natural Heritage Program (NNHP) 
At-Risk Plant and Animal Tracking List (NNHP 2020). Protected/regulated species are those that are 
protected or regulated by federal or state law. Many species are both sensitive and protected/regulated 
(Table 2-1). Important biological resources include cover sites, nest or burrow sites, roost sites, or water 
sources important to sensitive species. Survey reports document species and resources found and provide 
mitigation recommendations. 

 2.1 SITES SURVEYED AND SENSITIVE AND PROTECTED/REGULATED 
     SPECIES OBSERVED 

 In 2019, biological surveys were conducted for 33 projects on the NNSS (Figure 2-1 and Table 2-2). 
Scientists surveyed a total of 141.2 hectares (ha) for the projects (Table 2-2). The surveyed area included 
the project area and a buffer area extending 10-20 meters (m) beyond the project area. Twenty-one 
 projects were within the range of the threatened desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii) (see Section 3.0). 
Although within the range of the desert, several of these projects did not have the potential to disturb 
tortoise habitat. Three projects were within the Frenchman Flat desert tortoise exclusion zone (an area 
identified as having very low tortoise presence), five projects were within buildings and five other 
projects were in disturbed areas. Sensitive and protected/regulated wildlife species and important 
biological resources found during the surveys included bird nesting sites; western red-tailed skink habitat 
(Plestiodon gilberti rubricaudatus); predator burrows utilized by desert tortoises; bat sign within 
abandoned buildings; ungulate sign (pronghorn antelope [Antilocapra americana], feral burro [Equus 
asinus], feral horse [Equus caballus] and mule deer [Odocoileus hemionus]); two sensitive plant species 
(Cane Spring Suncup [Camissonia megalantha] and sand cholla [Grusonia pulchella]); yucca plants 
(Joshua tree [Yucca brevifolia] and Mojave yucca [Yucca schidigera]); singleleaf pinyon (Pinus 
monophylla); and multiple cactus species (see Table 2-2 for resources listed by project). Scientists 
communicated with ground crews and provided written summary reports to project managers of survey 
findings and mitigation recommendations when applicable (Table 2-2). 

 2.2 POTENTIAL HABITAT DISTURBANCE 

 Biological surveys are conducted for all activities that have the potential to disturb habitat. These surveys 
are required in undisturbed habitat, whenever vegetation has re-colonized old disturbances, and/or 
sensitive or protected/regulated species may occur in the area. For example, desert tortoises may move 
through project areas and may be concealed under vegetation during activities where heavy equipment is 
used, and western burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia hypugaea) frequently inhabit burrows, buried

 pipes with exposed openings, and culverts at disturbed sites. Biological surveys are completed to ensure 
 sensitive  or protected/regulated animal and plant species are not in harm’s way. 

 During  vegetation mapping surveys of the NNSS, delineated areas of homogeneous plant and wildlife 
 communities were identified and referred to as Ecological Landform Units (ELUs) (Ostler et al. 2000). 
     
 These ELUs were evaluated for importance with the intent that comparable ELUs would respond 
 similarly  to land management practices. This concept was later applied to categorizing groupings of ELUs 
 into important habitat types as follow: Pristine Habitat (having few human-made disturbances), Unique 
 Habitat (containing uncommon biological resources such as a natural wetland), Sensitive Habitat 
(containing vegetation associations that recover very slowly from direct disturbance or are susceptible to 
erosion), and Diverse Habitat (having high plant species diversity) (U.S. Department of Energy, Nevada 
Operations Office [DOE/NV] 1998). 

Project 18-07 disturbed 1.02 ha of Sensitive Habitat and project 18-66 disturbed 2.26 ha of habitat 
considered Unique and Sensitive. The total area disturbed (ha) of important habitat types tracked since 
1999 comprises 9.46 (Pristine), 19.72 (Unique), 382.79 (Sensitive), and 87.05 (Diverse). Projects in 2019 
disturbed a total of 8.98 ha of undisturbed land (Table 2-2). Projects utilize previously disturbed areas as 
well as existing roads as much as possible to minimize the disturbance of habitat.

 Desert tortoises occur within the southern one-third of the NNSS. This species is listed as threatened 
 under the Endangered Species Act. In December 1995, NNSA/NFO completed consultation with the 
 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) concerning the effects of NNSA/NFO activities, as described in the 
 Final Environmental Impact Statement for the Nevada Test Site and Off-Site Locations in the State of 
 Nevada (DOE/NV 1996), on the desert tortoise. NNSA/NFO received a Biological Opinion from FWS in 
 August 1996 (FWS 1996). On July 2, 2008, NNSA/NFO provided FWS with a Biological Assessment of 
 anticipated activities on the NNSS from 2009 through 2019. NNSA/NFO received the Programmatic 
 Biological Opinion on February 12, 2009 (FWS 2009). On February 27, 2019, NNSA/NFO provided 
 FWS with a Biological Assessment of anticipated activities on the NNSS from 2019 through 2029 and 
 entered into formal consultation with FWS to obtain a new Biological Opinion. NNSA/NFO received the 
 new Programmatic Biological Opinion (Opinion) on August 27, 2019 (FWS 2019-2). 

 Desert tortoise compliance on the NNSS was covered under two Opinions in 2019; the February 12, 2009 
 through August 26, 2019 Opinion (FWS 2009) and the new Opinion beginning August 27, 2019 covering 
 the next ten years (FWS 2019-2). Updates to the new Opinion allow the NNSS to proceed with projects 
 less than 20 acres (ac) or linear projects less than one mile in length without further consultation with 
 FWS, while still complying with the protective measures for the desert tortoise outlined in the Opinion. 
 The tortoise exclusion zones identified in the 1996 Opinion (areas designated as having such low tortoise 
 presence they were exempt from the terms and conditions under the Opinion and continued to remain in 
 effect through August 26, 2019) were eliminated based on recent tortoise observations with in the zones. 
 Notable updates to the Opinion also include more detailed protective measures to ensure fewer tortoise 
 mortalities and injuries during projects and activities on the NNSS. 

 The Desert Tortoise Compliance task of EMAC implements the protective measures of the 2019 Opinion, 
 documents compliance actions taken by NNSA/NFO, and assists NNSA/NFO in FWS consultations. All 
 protective measures listed in the Opinion were implemented by MSTS staff biologists in 2019, including 
 (a) conducting 100% coverage tortoise clearance surveys (TCS) at project sites within 24 hours from the 
 start of project construction, (b) ensuring projects have a Desert Tortoise Monitor (DTM) on site during 
 site clearing and heavy equipment operation, (c) developing effects analysis for proposed disturbances to 
 append to the Opinion, and (d) preparing an annual compliance report for NNSA/NFO submittal to FWS. 

 3.1 PROJECT SURVEYS AND COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION 

 Twenty-six projects occurring within the range of the desert tortoise were reviewed by biologists in 2019 
and three projects in progress were carried over from 2018 (Table 3-1). The review process to determine 
 the impacts each project may have on the desert tortoise was streamlined with updates from the new 
 Opinion (FWS 2019-2). Projects are now placed in one of three categories based on biological review: 
 framework programmatic action (requires surveys and formal consultation with FWS), program-level 
action (requires surveys but no consultation with FWS), or no effects to the desert tortoise (surveys may 
still be completed based on other important species in the project area). Once placed in one of the 
categories, required compliance activities are determined and completed (Table 3-1).  

Depending on the potential for sensitive and protected/regulated species to be within a project area, 
biologists conduct appropriate surveys for each land-disturbing activity prior to project start. A tortoise 
clearance survey is required within 24 hours before the start of a project when there is a possibility that a 
tortoise may be in the project area, adjacent land or if there is a possibility a tortoise may wander into the 
project area during construction activities. A pre-activity survey is completed by walking meandering 
transects or the entire area and is required when there is no possibility of a tortoise being encountered

 a Project carried over from 2018. 
 b Habitat disturbance will be reported upon project completion 
  
 during the project’s activities but other sensitive and protected/regulated species may be encountered. A 
pre-activity survey for buildings is required prior to demolition of buildings or relocation of trailers. The 
pre-activity survey for buildings also includes a survey of the outside of the building and the entire 
construction area. 

Twenty-one surveys were completed by biologists within the range of the desert tortoise in 2019, with 
one project, 19-19, having two survey locations (Figure 3-1). No desert tortoises were observed or 
reported injured or killed during projects. Post-activity surveys confirm the amount of desert tortoise 
habitat disturbed for each project. Desert tortoise habitat was not disturbed during 2019. Two in-progress 
projects (18-66 and 19-16) are scheduled to disturb tortoise habitat. The disturbance will be documented 
upon project completion and completion of a post-activity survey. All projects that were monitored within 
tortoise habitat remained within the surveyed area. This is determined by means of delineating the area of 
disturbance and constant communication between ground crews and biologists. 

In January 2020, the annual report summarizing tortoise compliance activities conducted on the NNSS 
from January 1 through December 31, 2019 was submitted to FWS. This report, required under the 
Opinion, contains (a) the location and size of land disturbances that occurred within the range of the 
desert tortoise; (b) the number of desert tortoises injured, killed, or relocated off project sites; (c) a map 
showing the location of all tortoises sighted or relocated from on or near roads as well as vehicular 
mortalities; and (d) a summary of construction mitigation and monitoring efforts. 

Compliance with the Opinion ensures the desert tortoise is protected on the NNSS and the cumulative 
impacts on this species are minimized (DOE/NV 1998). In the Opinion, FWS determined the “incidental 
take” (“take” means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to 
attempt to engage in any such conduct, and “incidental take” is a take that results from activities that are 
otherwise lawful) of tortoises on the NNSS and the cumulative acreage of tortoise habitat disturbed on the

 NNSS are parameters that should be measured and monitored annually. With the transition to the new 
 Opinion in August 2019, the 2009 Opinion’s take limits were totaled, finalized, and reported to FWS 
 (Table 3-2). Take amounts and renegotiated limits began on August 27, 2019 with the new Opinion going 
 into effect (Table 3-3). 

 There were 66 reported desert tortoise roadside sightings during 2019 (Figure 3-2). Fifty-four of the 
 encountered tortoises were determined to be in harm’s way and moved off the road (Figure 3-2) in 
 accordance with FWS-approved tortoise handling procedures. Of the 54 tortoises handled, 52 were 
considered incidental take (Table 3-2 and 3-3). Per FWS, beginning August 27, 2019, only large tortoises 
(                    length) shall be counted as incidental take. Small tortoises (<180 mm in 
length) that are encountered will be reported to FWS but not counted as incidental take due to their low 
detectability. 

Amongst the 54 tortoises moved off NNSS roads, one was a juvenile tortoise found with active bird 
predation wounds on its carapace (Figure 3-3). The tortoise was alive, taken to a veterinarian and later 
euthanized for its life-threatening injuries. Another of the encounters was an attempted canid predation 
(Figure 3-3). The tortoise was found flipped upside down on a road, with active puncture wounds on the 
anterior and posterior carapace. The predation injuries were not life threatening. The tortoise was moved 
well off the road and placed under a boulder. The tortoise was checked on the following day and was not 
 observed. Tortoises have several predators in the wild including ravens (Corvus corax), coyotes (Canis 
latrans), and kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis). When a tortoise is found with predation injuries, FWS is 
contacted to determine the best action for the well-being of the animal. 

As theorized by biologists, many of the tortoise encounters on roads are the same animals crossing the 
roads multiple times, termed repeat offenders. As determined through a study from 2012 through 2018, 
many tortoises have home ranges that overlap NNSS roads and these animals cross these roads many

 times throughout the active season. Three tortoises that were previously marked with identification 
 numbers were moved again off roads in 2019: NNSS14, NNSS16 and NNSS20 (Figure 3-2). Tortoise 
 NNSS16 was moved off the road twice; once in August and once in September. Two of the roadside 
 sightings were roadkills. The first was a juvenile tortoise found on June 20, 2019 on a dirt road in Area 5 
 (Figure 3-2). The location was within a tortoise exclusion zone and provided information for the 
 elimination of these zones during consultation for the new Opinion (FWS 2019-2). The second was an 
 adult tortoise found on June 21, 2019 on Jackass Flats Road in Area 22 (Figure 3-2). Both road 
 mortalities were reported to FWS and as incidental take (included in Table 3-2). 

  
 3.1.1 Mitigation for Loss of Tortoise Habitat 

 Prior to land-disturbing activities associated with any projects of the Work-for-Others program, the 
proponent shall pay remuneration fees to minimize effects from disturbance of desert tortoise habitat on 
the NNSS in accordance with FWS-approved instructions (FWS 2019-2). For land-disturbing activities 
that occur under all other programs (i.e., Defense, Waste Management, Environmental Restoration, 
Nondefense Research and Development and Infrastructure), NNSA/NFO will minimize effects from 
disturbance of desert tortoise habitat by funding and implementing FWS-approved conservation actions 
on the NNSS (FWS 2019-2). Remuneration fees are currently paid into the Clark County Desert 
Conservation Program for all Work-for-Others projects at the rate of $902 per acre of disturbance. All 
other projects are able to utilize the NNSS’s accrued funds from implementation of FWS-approved 
conservation studies. Deductions from the accrued funds are applied at a level equal to the rate of $902 
per acre of disturbance. 

Three projects under the Infrastructure Program were required to pay remuneration fees based on each 
project’s permanent disturbance of desert tortoise habitat. Project 18-66 has the potential to disturb 5.5 ac,

3.2  CONSERVATION RECOMMENDATIONS 

Biologists continue to increase tortoise awareness by updating and increasing tortoise signage throughout 
the NNSS. This year three faded tortoise awareness signs were replaced along access road entrances into 
the juvenile translocation study area (Figure 3-4). The locations of the signs are shown in Figure 3-2. 

Two desert tortoise conservation research studies have been approved by FWS and are being 
implemented by MSTS biologists; the desert tortoise road study and the juvenile translocation study. The 
following is a synopsis of activities conducted for each of these projects.

3.2.1 Road Study 

Per the Opinion, NNSA/NFO developed a desert tortoise study which focused on collecting fine-scale 
patterns of roadside habitat use by the desert tortoise for application in the future development and 
implementation of management practices in order to minimize road mortalities on the NNSS (FWS 2009).  

                                      18 
                                        Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 The research project was appended to the Opinion in April 2012 and implemented in May 2012. The main 
 objectives of this study were to (1) determine fine-scale patterns of habitat use of desert tortoises found 
near roads on the NNSS, and (2) assess the risk of desert tortoise road mortality on the NNSS. A 
secondary objective was to assess the health and condition of desert tortoises on the northern periphery of 
their range. FWS originally approved a handling take limit of twenty adult tortoises for the project and 
later approved the sample size increase to thirty adult tortoises. Field work for the study came to 
completion in September 2018. Preliminary results of the study were included in the 2018 EMAC report. 
A more detailed topical report is in progress. 

Because the largest threat to the desert tortoise on the NNSS is roads, research will continue on this topic. 
Biologists proposed an opportunistic mark-recapture study to continue documentation and research on 
tortoises whose home ranges overlap NNSS roads to FWS during consultation of the new Opinion in 
2019. The study was approved by FWS under the Opinion and allows permitted biologists to attach 
identification numbers to tortoises when they are found and moved safely off NNSS roads. The objectives 
of the study are to (1) determine if tortoises moved safely off roads are repeat offenders, (2) identify 
trends in repeat offenders crossing roads, and (3) assist with collection of tortoise density data. Marking 
tortoises found on roads for future identification will provide information on population size and trends 
over time, which will assist in future conservation and management efforts (Pike et al 2005). Field work 
for the study will begin in spring 2020 and continue through the duration of the Opinion. 

 3.2.2 Juvenile Translocation Study 

 In September 2012, 60 captive juvenile tortoises were translocated from the Desert Tortoise Conservation 
 Center in Las Vegas to the southern edge of the NNSS in Area 22 to evaluate the survival of juvenile 
tortoises released in the wild. The NNSS provides one of the largest protected habitat areas in southern 
Nevada. The project is part of a long-term collaborative effort involving FWS, MSTS, and the San Diego 
Zoo Institute for Conservation Research (ICR). Few studies have investigated translocated juvenile 
tortoise survival, so data obtained from this study will be valuable to assess translocation as a possible 
means of tortoise recovery.  

Each tortoise was affixed with a very high frequency transmitter prior to release for post-release 
monitoring purposes. Regular monitoring of the animals occurred post-release from 2012 through 2019. 
During 2019, monitoring occurred once in January and February; weekly in March, April and May; twice 
in June, July, and August; three times in September; weekly in October, twice in November and once in 
December. Additional monitoring was conducted in January 2020 to determine each tortoise’s winter 
burrow. At the beginning of 2019, 24 of 60 (40%) tortoises were alive. At the end of the year, 23 of the 60 
(38.3%) tortoises (8 female, 15 male) were known to be alive (Table 3-4, Figure 3-5). One male tortoise 
(4040) went missing on October 14, 2019. All that was found was its transmitter that had bite marks on it 
but no carcass or remains were found. It is assumed dead but a search will be made in the spring to try to 
locate it. Figure 3-5 shows the release locations for all 60 translocated juveniles, the winter burrows for 
the surviving 23 tortoises, and the location of the presumed dead tortoise. 

After 88 months post-release, 23 of the 60 juveniles were still alive (38.3% survival). This is somewhat 
higher but similar to an estimated 33% survival (20 of 60 tortoises alive) based on an annual survival rate 
of 0.85 that Turner et al. (1987) calculated in a natural population. There is a much higher survival rate 
for males (50% [15 of 30]) compared to females (28% [8 of 29]) with most of the mortalities suspected as 
coyote and kit fox predation. Given the importance of females surviving to adulthood to reproduce, this 
may be a critical life stage for females. If female juveniles are not surviving to sexual maturity, this could 
lead to a decline in tortoise populations. Mulder et al. (2017) found that adult female fitness and 
integration following translocation was high which suggests that survival and integration and acceptance 
of translocated female tortoises into a natural population may be key to a successful translocation. The 


                                       19

 more females, resident or translocated, that survive the greater the fecundity which should result in 
 population increases. Understanding differential mortality in both resident and translocated juvenile 
 tortoises of both sexes warrants further study. 

Table 3-4 contains information about the 24 juvenile tortoises monitored during 2019. On average, the 
 distance between the release location and winter 2019-2020 burrow (i.e., the burrow a juvenile was in 
during the first part of January 2020) was 789 m (range 77–6,367 m; standard deviation [sd] 1,350 m). 
On average, tortoises used winter burrows in 2020, 78 m away from their 2019 winter burrows. Over 
two-thirds (16 of 23) of the tortoises wintered in burrows within 100 m of their last year’s winter burrow, 
and 30% (7 of 23) of them used the same winter burrow as the previous year.

The distance (m) between monitoring checks was calculated and is summarized in Table 3-4. This is not 
the total distance a tortoise moved during the year, but the summed distance between locations recorded 
during regular monitoring. It is important to note that movements tortoises made between monitoring 
checks were not recorded or measured. For females the average distance moved was 2,294 m, and for 
males 2,382 m. A two-tailed, t-test was used to determine if this difference was statistically significant at 
(alpha level) = 0.05. It was not significant (p [probability] = 0.9). 
During 2019, burrows were marked with unique numbers and data collected included Universal 
Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates (North American Datum [NAD] 83), burrow height, burrow 
width, burrow orientation, elevation, location, topographic position, vegetation cover and substrate. The 
number of unique burrows an individual used was calculated and is shown in Table 3-4. It is important to 
note that tortoise burrows were only documented during tracking checks, and therefore all burrows used 
may not have been documented. A total of 122 unique burrows were used by the 24 tortoises, and the 
number of new burrows marked and measured during 2019 was 60. The average height of burrows was 
10.5 mm (range 6-25 mm; sd 3.0 mm) and average width of burrows was 22.9 mm (range 15-30 mm; sd 
3.6 mm). On average, tortoises used 5.1 unique burrows (range 3-8; sd = 1.6) (Table 3-4) with no 
significant difference between females (4.5 burrows) and males (5.4 burrows) (p = 0.13). One burrow 
(#482) was occupied by two different tortoises; Female 4044 in May and Male 4019 in October. Timing

 of arrival at winter burrows differs between years (Table 3-5) and appears to be influenced by temperature 
 and moisture. If enough moisture is received in the fall to cause plant germination and regrowth and 
 temperatures are mild, tortoises continue to move around and forage into November (Hall et al. 2016). 
 Precipitation during summer and fall was sparse, resulting in little food for tortoises to eat. Three tortoises 
 moved burrows between mid-November and early December probably in response to significant moisture 
 received in late November that collapsed a few burrows. 
 Observations made while tracking from January 2019 to January 2020 on the 24 surviving juvenile 
tortoises totaled 787. Tortoises were inside burrows 63% of the time and aboveground 37% of the time 
including under vegetation or a boulder (23%), in the open (10%), in the burrow mouth (4%), or on the 
burrow apron (1%) (Figure 3-6). Of the 174 observations under vegetation, 52.3% were under blackbrush 
(Coleogyne ramosissima), 14.9% were under Nevada jointfir (Ephedra nevadensis), 7.5% were under 
 mixed shrub species clumps, and the remaining 25% under 10 other shrub species including 5.7% pale 
 desert thorn (Lyicum pallidum); 5.2% water jacket (Lycium andersonii); 5.2% Fremont’s dalea 
 (Psorothamnus fremontii); 4.0% creosote bush (Larrea tridentata); 1.7% burrobrush (Hymenoclea 
 salsola); and spiny hopsage (Grayia spinosa), threadleaf snakeweed (Gutierrezia microcephala), 
winterfat (Krascheninnikovia lanata), spiny menodora (Menodora spinescens), and Mojave Yucca (Yucca 
schidigera) all < 1.0% (Figure 3-7). It is noteworthy that more than half of the tortoise observations under 
vegetation were under blackbrush. Additional studies are needed to determine if there is a preference for 
blackbrush or if it is just the dominant shrub. 
For the 60 new burrows, tortoises used burrows on wash slopes over 70% of the time followed by burrows 
in wash bottoms and washlets (Figure 3-8). Vegetation cover at burrows was found at 95% of the 
burrows, suggesting this may be an important factor in burrow use for these juveniles. Mixed shrub 
clumps seemed to be the dominant cover followed by Nevada jointfir, creosote bush, pale desert thorn, 
burrobrush, and white bursage (Ambrosia dumosa). Fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), blackbrush, 
and water jacket made up the other category (Figure 3-9).   
Gravel was the dominant substrate and was observed at over one-third of all new juvenile tortoise 
burrows (Figure 3-10), followed by cobble, gravel/cobble and sandy/gravel. Gravel is defined as rocks 
<2.5 centimeters (cm) in size, cobble as rocks between 2.5 and 12.7 cm, rock as >12.7 cm, and solid rock 
is bedrock. The other category is made up of cobble/rock (6.7%), sandy (6.7%), sandy/cobble (3.3%), 
sandy/gravel/cobble (1.7%), and sandy/rock (1/7%). Combined categories such as gravel/cobble means 
that both were equal in abundance.

 Evidence of foraging was documented for all 24 tortoises 152 times between March 26 and October 1, 
 2019, with foraging peaks in April (73 times) and May (51 times) (Figure 3-11). The most common 
 observed species eaten were bluedicks (Dichelostemma capitatum) (5.9%) (Figure 3-12), desert 
 globemallow (Sphaeralcea ambigua) (1.3%), and desert dandelion (Malacothrix glabrata) (1.3%). Nine 
 other species were observed being eaten by tortoises one time each: whitemargin sandmat (Chamaesyce 
 albomarginata), cleftleaf wildheliotrope (Phacelia crenulata), Arabian schismus (Schismus arabicus), 
 brittle spineflower (Chorizanthe brevicornu), redstem stork’s bill (Erodium cicutarium), Langloisia spp., 
 Pacific blazingstar (Mentzelia obscura), yellow cups (Camissonia brevipes), and brightwhite 
 (Prenanthella exigua). Most (85%) of the time, it was not possible to identify what the tortoises had 
 eaten. One tortoise (4046) was observed eating dirt on May 22, 2019. Winter and spring precipitation was 
 nearly double the average amount and temperatures remained relatively cool into June. Vegetation 
 production was high during the spring green-up and there was an abundant, diverse community of native 
 forbs available for tortoises to forage on, especially during April and May. Fortunately, the cool, wet 
 spring was not very conducive to brome growth in un-burned areas. Due to the cooler temperatures, most 
 tortoises did not become active until the end of March or first part of April which explains the low 
 number of foraging observations in March. Summer/fall precipitation was below normal which resulted in 
 reduced plant production and reduced foraging opportunities during this time period. 

 All transmitters were changed in the fall, and health assessments were conducted at the time of transmitter 
 changes except for one tortoise (4030) which could not be extracted from a deep burrow. Tortoises were 
 also measured, weighed and given a Body Condition Score (BCS) (1-3 = under condition, 4-6 = good 
 condition, 7-9 = over condition) in both spring and fall. Table 3-6 contains information on midline 
carapace length (MCL) (mm) and BCS for fall 2012 (pre-release), spring 2019 and fall 2019 and weight 
without transmitter (g) for fall 2012 (pre-release) and fall 2019.

 On average, the surviving 24 translocated juvenile desert tortoises increased 49 mm in MCL and 
 631 grams (g) in weight (without transmitters) from fall 2012 to fall 2019. Results from a 
 two-tailed t-test showed there was no significant difference ( ) in MCL growth between 
females (43 mm) and males (52 mm) (p = 0.31) or in weight gain between females (525 g) and 
males (677 g) (p = 0.34). Average growth in MCL from spring 2019 to fall 2019 was 10 mm with 
no significant difference between females (11 mm) and males (10 mm) (p =  0.57). An analysis of 
annual growth revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.91) between October to March precipitation 
and growth in MCL. The most growth occurred in years when October to March precipitation 
was greater than 116 mm. Body condition scores indicated all tortoises were in good condition in 
2019, except for Male 4033 which was under condition at 3.5 during the fall assessment. 

The main factor for survival appears to be gender with higher survival of males than females. 
This has been observed by other researchers as well (Melia Nafus, ICR, personal communication, 
December 4, 2014). Size, weight, overall health, and presence of Mycoplasma species (bacteria 
that causes upper respiratory disease in tortoises) do not seem to have any significant impact on 
survival. While it is impossible to determine if a tortoise was scavenged or preyed upon, a 
majority of dead tortoises have shown signs of being chewed on by mammalian predators. Given 
the presumed healthy status and low disease prevalence in the juveniles, it seems unlikely that 
they are dying and then being scavenged. This suggests that most of the mortality is due to 
predation. Coyote and kit fox tracks have been observed on multiple occasions while conducting 
tortoise monitoring, and these canids appear to be the main predators predating study animals. 
To better understand the predator community and visitation frequency, a camera trap was set up 
at Site 2 for 140 days from March to August, 2017; 318 days between January and December, 
2018; and 239 days between May and December, 2019 for a total of 697 days. Results showed 
8 coyote images which is about one every 87 days, 9 kit fox images which is about one every 
77 days, 8 badger (Taxidea taxus) images which is about one every 87 days, and 4 bobcat (Lynx 
rufus) images which is about one every 174 days.   
Why canid predation is higher on females than males is a question yet to be answered. Coyotes 
and kit foxes use olfaction as one of their dominant senses, therefore it is possible that females are 
giving off scent that makes them easier to detect. Another possibility is females spend more time 
aboveground or travel farther, thus making them more susceptible to predation. An analysis 
conducted on March to October observations from 2012-2017 showed that females actually spend 
more time in their burrows (p = 0.01) and less time in the open (p = 0.02) than males and that 
females and males travel similar distances (p = 0.76).  
In order to help better understand the interaction between tortoises and their predators, oral, 
cloacal, and chin/forelimb swabs were collected from all 27 juvenile tortoises and 27 adult 
tortoises from the road study (10 females, 16 males, 1 unknown) during fall 2015. Additional 
samples were taken from 26 juveniles (18 males, 8 females) and 12 adults (9 males, 2 females, 
1 unknown) during fall 2017. These samples were sent to Dr. Bruce Kimball at the Monell 
Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and analyzed using headspace gas 
chromatography/mass spectrometry to describe chemical signatures and detect any chemical 
differences between males and females as well as between adults and juveniles that might cause 
increased canid predation. Results revealed differences between female and male juveniles, 
primarily in alkyl alcohols.  

A preliminary field trial was conducted in September 2018, at the United States Department of 
Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, National Wildlife Research Center 
(USDA-APHIS-NWRC), Millville Predator Research Facility in collaboration with Dr. Eric Gese 
(USDA-APHIS NWRC) and Dr. Kimball. Synthesized female and male tortoise scent and a

 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 control were presented to captive coyotes to determine if they showed any preference. Initial 
 results showed no preference for the female, male, or control scent. Dr. Kimball refined the scent 
 in 2019 to better accentuate the differences between males and females, and another trial at the 
 Millville facility was conducted in September 2019. Similar to 2018, the captive coyotes showed 
 no preference for the female, male, or control scent. These coyotes were naïve to desert tortoises 
 having never encountered one, so a field trial at the NNSS was conducted in tortoise habitat, 
 assuming that coyotes and kit foxes in this area had encountered desert tortoises. The study was 
 conducted in late October/early November. Paired stations with female scent and male scent 
 randomly placed on opposite sides of a dirt road were set up at 15 locations, spaced about 500 
 meters apart. A 1-m2 area was cleared so animal tracks would be visible in the dirt, and the scent 
was placed in the middle of this cleared area. Sites were checked daily for 9 days (except for one 
two-day check) from October 30 to November 7. During each check, cleared areas were checked 
for canid tracks and then cleared of all tracks. Results showed two kit fox visits to female scent 
and two visits to male scent. No coyote tracks were detected. Canids did not show a preference 
for female or male tortoise scent. Data from the synthesized chemical scents and observations 
from all three trials suggest that although there are chemical differences between female and male 
juvenile tortoises, this does not account for increased predator attraction or curiosity toward 
female tortoises and would not, therefore account for increased predation of female tortoises.  

MSTS will continue monitoring the remaining juvenile study animals well into adulthood with 
adjustments to the monitoring schedule based on the animals’ movement activities. Data analysis 
and publications will be a joint effort between NNSA/NFO and ICR.  

 3.2.3 USGS Rock Valley Study 

 The United States Geological Survey (USGS) in collaboration with FWS, ICR, and Penn State 
 University completed their epidemiology study in the Rock Valley pens in September 2017. All 
 translocated tortoises were removed from the three pens and transported back to Las Vegas. An 
 MSTS biologist assisted in this effort.  

 As a result of this study, some mating of translocated individuals occurred and a few juvenile 
 tortoises were observed within the pens. FWS considers these resident tortoises. MSTS biologists 
 conducted full coverage surveys of all three pens to identify recent tortoise sign or live juvenile 
 tortoises inside the pens in 2018. No active burrows, live tortoises, or carcasses were observed. 
One nonviable tortoise egg was found on the surface under a shrub. No monitoring was 
conducted in 2019. MSTS biologists will monitor the pens during 2020 in order to determine if 
live juvenile tortoises are present. 

 3.2.4 Coordination with Other Biologists and Wildlife Agencies 
      In February 2019, an MSTS biologist attended the Desert Tortoise Council’s 44th annual 
      meeting and symposium. This meeting was held in Tucson, Arizona and included 
      numerous presentations on desert tortoise biology, ecology, and recovery efforts. 

      In May 2019, MSTS biologists conducted a tour of desert tortoise habitat on the NNSS 
      for FWS biologists. 

      In May 2019, an MSTS biologist attended the Interagency Consultation for Endangered 
      Species, hosted by FWS at the Desert National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center in Las 
      Vegas, NV. The training provided an overview of required agency actions to comply with 
      the Endangered Species Act.

 4.0  ECOSYSTEM MONITORING 

 Biologists began comprehensive mapping of plant communities and wildlife habitat on the NNSS 
 in 1996. Data were collected, describing selected biotic and abiotic habitat features within field 
 mapping units called ecological landform units (ELUs). ELUs are landforms (Peterson 1981) 
 with similar vegetation, soil, slope, and hydrology. Boundaries of the ELUs were defined using 
 aerial photographs, satellite imagery, and field confirmation. ELUs are considered by site 
 biologists to be the most feasible mapping unit by which sensitive plant and animal habitats can 
 be described. In 2000 and 2001, topical reports describing the classification of vegetation types 
 on the NNSS were published (Ostler et al. 2000, Wills and Ostler 2001). Ten vegetation alliances 
 and 20 associations were reported to occur on the NNSS. 
 In addition to ELU mapping, ecosystem monitoring also entails monitoring a wide variety of 
 terrestrial and aquatic habitats and non-sensitive and protected/regulated species. Efforts during 
 2019 focused on wildland fire fuels surveys, natural water source monitoring, and constructed 
water source monitoring, including contaminated sumps. 
 4.1 VEGETATION SURVEY FOR WILDLAND FIRE HAZARD ASSESSMENT  

 Wildland fires on the NNSS require considerable financial resources for fire suppression and 
 mitigation. For example, costs for fire suppression on or near the NNSS can cost as much as 
 $198 per ha (Hansen and Ostler 2004). Costs incurred from the Egg Point Fire in August 2002 
 (121 ha) were well over $1 million to replace 1 mile of burned power poles, and more than 
 $200,000 for soil stabilization and revegetation of the burned area. 

 4.1.1 Wildland Fires in 2019 

 From 1978 to 2019, an average of 10.3 wildland fires per year and about 98.0 ha per fire have 
 occurred on the NNSS. Most wildland fires are caused by lightning and do not occur randomly 
 across the NNSS, but occur more often in particular vegetation types (e.g., blackbrush and pinyon 
 pine/Utah juniper/sagebrush [Pinus monophylla/Juniperus osteosperma/Artemisia spp.] plant 
 communities). These types have sufficient woody and fine-textured fuels that are conducive to 
ignition and spread of wildland fires. Once a site burns, it is much more likely to burn again 
because of the invasive annual plants that quickly colonize these areas (Brooks and Lusk 2008). 

Two wildland fires were reported on the NNSS in 2019. Both of them occurred on April 29 and 
both were 0.1 ac in size and were extinguished by NNSS Fire and Rescue personnel or carefully 
monitored until they burned out. 

 4.1.2 Fuel Survey Methods 

 Beginning in 2004, and in response to DOE O 231.1B, surveys were initiated on the NNSS to 
 identify wildland fire hazards. Vegetation surveys were conducted between April 24 and June 11, 
 2019, at sites located along and adjacent to major NNSS corridors to estimate the abundance of 
 fuels produced by native and invasive plants. Information about climate was also identified and 
 summarized as part of the wildland fire hazards assessment.  

 The abundance of fine-textured (grasses and herbs) and coarse-textured (woody) fuels were 
 visually estimated on numerical scales using an 11-point potential scale: 0 to 5 (in 0.5 increments, 
 where 0.0 is barren and 5.0 is near maximum biomass encountered on the NNSS). Details of the 


                                    30

 methodology used to conduct the spring survey for assessing wildland fire hazards on the NNSS 
 are described in a report by Hansen and Ostler (2004). 

 Photographs of sites typifying these different scale values are found in Appendix A of the 
 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program Calendar Year 2005 Report (Bechtel Nevada 
2006). Additionally, the numerical abundance rating for fine fuels at a site was added to the 
numerical abundance rating of woody fuels to derive a combined fuels rating for each site that 
ranged from 0 to 10 in one-half integer increments. The index ratings for fuels at these survey 
sites were then plotted on a GIS map and color-coded for abundance to indicate the wildland fire 
fuel hazards at various locations across the NNSS. 

 4.1.3 Fuel Survey Results 

 4.1.3.1 Climate 

 There were 17 rain gauges on the NNSS (Hansen and Ostler 2004) that were used historically to 
 measure precipitation. Data from these weather station gauges extends back more than 30 years 
 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] 2013). In the fall of 2011, most of 
 the rain gauges on the NNSS were upgraded from weighing gauges to tipping-bucket style gauges 
 with data transmitted directly to NOAA via telecommunications, rather than manually retrieving 
 and processing the data (D. J. Hansen, personal communication, May 4, 2012). In most cases, the 
 new gauges were relocated nearby to facilitate data collection. The changes were made to reduce 
 costs, improve data reliability, and improve access time to the data after precipitation events. As a 
 result of these modifications, only 14 rain gauges remain from the original gauge stations. The 
 Cane Spring, Tippipah Spring, and Rock Valley gauge stations were decommissioned. The 
 Jackass Flats gauge was moved to Port Gaston in Area 26. The Little Feller 2 gauge was moved 
 from the eastern part of Area 18 to the northwestern corner of Area 18. Precipitation data 
 collected in 2019 reflect the changes and attempt to match, as closely as possible, data collected 
 historically. Mean values were recalculated to account for periods when gauges were not 
 functional. 

 In order to assess whether the spring of the year would be relatively wet, normal, or dry, a simple 
 measure of precipitation was needed. Precipitation during the months of December, January, 
 February, March, and April was selected because of its simplicity and ease of calculation 
 (Figure 4-1). While it is recognized that precipitation from other months is also important, as is 
 the influence of temperature, winds, and relative humidity, precipitation during these months 
 represents the period that most influences plant growth on the NNSS as observed along the 
 survey route. This period occurs before the beginning of the fire season in June so it allows one to 
 make a prediction of the fuels that may be present. During the first 10 years of conducting fire 
 fuel evaluations (2004-2013), the mean precipitation during these 5 months is correlated 
 (R = 0.77) with our estimations of the combined fuel loads. During 2019, the average 
 precipitation from the remaining 14 rain gauge stations on the NNSS during December–April was 
 192.6 mm, which is well above the average amount of 104.6 mm received on the NNSS. In fact, 
 this was the second wettest period recorded since monitoring began in 2004, and only slightly 
 lower than 200.0 mm recorded in 2004-05 (Figure 4-1).

           years 2004 through 2019. 

 4.1.3.2 Fuels 

 Due to the above-average precipitation received during winter/spring 2018-19, production of 
 annual forbs and grasses was high. Production of perennial herbaceous grasses and forbs was 
 also high.  

 The fine fuels index increased in 2019 (2.41) compared to 2018 (1.83), and was the fifth highest 
 recorded since 2004 (Table 4-1). Most of the fine fuels were from annual forbs rather than 
 invasive annual grasses such as red brome (Bromus rubens) and cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum). 
Although these species were present and dominated previously burned areas; natural, unburned-
areas had relatively low red brome and cheatgrass production even though precipitation was so 
high. It was a cool, wet spring which favors annual forb production rather than red brome and 
cheatgrass production. 

The woody fuels index value was slightly higher in 2019 (2.59) than in 2018 (2.49) (Table 4-1). 
This was an average value in comparison to the other index values since 2004.   

The combined index values (fine fuels plus woody fuels) for 2019 corresponds to the potential for 
fuels on the NNSS to support wildland fires once fuels are ignited. The higher the index, the 
greater the potential for wildland fires to spread. The NNSS average combined index value for 
fine fuels and woody fuels for 2019 was 5.00, which was the fifth highest value recorded since 
2004 (Table 4-1), suggesting above-normal fuels for the NNSS.  

The locations and results of the fine fuels, woody fuels and combined fuels surveys at 104 
stations on the NNSS inspected during 2019 are shown in Figures 4-2, 4-3 and 4-4, respectively. 
The highest combined index values and thus the highest potential for wildland fires occurred in 
Fortymile Canyon, Mid Valley and southern Yucca Flat. High amounts of fine fuels were found 
in Fortymile Canyon, Yucca Flat, and Mid Valley. High amounts of woody fuels were primarily

found in the forested portions of Pahute Mesa, but also occurred along Stockade Wash Road, 
Buckboard Mesa Road, north Mid Valley Road, Cane Spring Road, upper Fortymile Canyon, and

Photographs were taken from permanent locations for all 104 sites during the past 14 years. 
Figure 4-5 shows photographs of Site 99 in Yucca Flat for the years 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. 
These photographs are valuable for many reasons, including providing a permanent record of 
previous site conditions, comparing site conditions among sites and years, and evaluating current 
year production with residual fuels from previous years.

4.1.4  Invasive Plants 

The three most commonly observed invasive annual plants to colonize the NNSS are Arabian schismus, found at 
low elevations; red brome, found at low to moderate elevations; and cheatgrass, found at middle to high elevations 
(Table 4-2).   

Cheatgrass was the most common invasive plant occurring on 79% of the study sites. While it was predominantly 
found at middle to higher elevations it was found at lower elevation sites as well. Red brome (67%) and redstem 
stork’s bill (50%) were found on at least half of the sites sampled. Precipitation history (Figure 4-1, shown 
previously) is important in determining the percent presence of species across the NNSS. During periods of low 
precipitation, most annual species have low percent presence (i.e., the number of sites in which the plant was 
observed to be present and growing). Percent presence is generally greatest during periods of high precipitation, 
and appears to be a good indication of germination. Higher percent presence is also expected to occur when 
regional storms provide precipitation to a greater number of operational areas across the NNSS. However, the 
responses of some species, both invasive and native species, suggest that other variables, such as the timing of 
precipitation or temperatures required for germination, may also be contributing to plant response both in terms of 
plant abundance and biomass produced. Red brome and cheatgrass for example were found at 67% and 79% of 
sites sampled, respectively, but did not account for a majority of the biomass at many sites. Rather, conditions were 
more conducive to native annual forb germination and biomass production. Cool, wet springs appear to favor native 
annual forbs over red brome and cheatgrass, especially in unburned areas.  

Colonization by invasive species such as cheatgrass, red brome, and Arabian schismus increases the likelihood of 
future wildland fires because they provide abundant fine fuels that are more closely spaced than native vegetation. 
Blackbrush vegetation types appear to be the most vulnerable plant communities to fire, followed by pinyon 
pine/Utah juniper/sagebrush species vegetation types. Wildland fires are costly to control and to mitigate once they 
occur. Revegetation of severely burned areas can be very slow without reseeding or transplanting with native 
species and other rehabilitation efforts. Blackbrush, sagebrush, juniper and pinyon pine do not resprout following 
fires. Untreated areas become much more vulnerable to future fires once invasive grass species, rather than native 
species, colonize a burned area.  

Overall, the hazards of residual fuels contributing to wildland fires were above average for 2019 and presented a 
wildland fire risk. However, because of the cool, wet spring soil moisture remained high and vegetation did not dry 
out until mid-June, thus shortening the wildland fire season by more than a month. Once ignited, high ambient 
temperatures and high winds contribute to the spread of fire in areas where the abundance of fuels is sufficient to 
carry the flames of the fire. This is particularly acute in areas such as Fortymile Canyon and Mid Valley that have 
burned previously and now consist of almost pure stands of cheatgrass and/or red brome. Rapid response by NNSS 
Fire and Rescue after fires are ignited is a key factor in minimizing wildland fire spread and severity.

 4.2 REPTILE STUDIES 

 No formal trapping or roadkill studies took place in 2019. However, some opportunistic reptile 
 observations were documented. The purpose of ongoing reptile sampling is to fill in data gaps for species 
 that have not been documented recently or are rare on the NNSS. 

 One night snake (Hypsiglena torquata) was found on a project site in Mercury and moved a safe distance 
 away from the project. One ground snake (Sonora semiannulata) was found on a glue trap in a building in 
 Mercury. It was extracted and released back into the desert. 

 4.3  NATURAL WATER SOURCE MONITORING 

 Nine natural water sources (six springs, three rock tanks) were monitored with motion-activated cameras 
 in 2019, primarily to document the presence of mountain lions (Puma concolor) and other wildlife 
(Figure 4-6). Results are found in Table 6-5 (see Section 6.7.1, Motion-Activated Cameras). General 
assessments were also made of each spring and surrounding area to document major disturbances or 
changes to these important water sources. During 2019, Topopah Spring was nearly dry with just a small 
wet spot in the cave pool. Vegetation was heavily trampled primarily by burros (Equus asinus) and mule 
deer (Odocoileus hemionus) at Twin Spring with numerous new burro trails on the slope leading to the 
spring. There was also a small perennial pool of standing water. Vegetation at Captain Jack Spring was 
 pretty dense in the absence of feral horses using the perennial spring, and cattails (Typha domingensis) 
 were very dense around Cane Spring.   

 Twin Spring had the most images (4,280; 6 mammals, 7 birds) which is astounding given that the camera 
 was only operational for about 40 days in mid-May/early June and the first half of November. Only 30 
 images of mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) and 1 image of chukar (Alectoris chukar) were taken in 
 May/early June with all other images taken in November. Mule deer and burros were photographed the 
 most with 1,386 and 1,375 images taken, respectively; while 1,274 images of chukar were recorded. 
 Several desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni) rams (107 images) and a flock of pinyon jays 
(Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) (41 images) were also recorded. 

Delirium Canyon Tanks (#5) had the highest species richness with 10 mammal and seven bird species 
detected in 2,753 images. Mourning doves (1,677 images) and desert bighorn sheep (820 images) were 
the most photographed species. Noteworthy species detected include ring-tailed cat (Bassariscus astutus), 
spotted skunk (Spilogale gracilis), cliff chipmunk (Tamias dorsalis), bats, and indigo bunting (Passerina 
cyanea) (Figure 4-7). 

Six mammals, five birds, and one reptile were photographed at Cottonwood Spring. A total of 2,108 
images were taken dominated by 1,581 images of house finches (Haemorhous mexicanus) and 365 
images of desert bighorn sheep. Noteworthy observations were bats and loggerhead shrike (Lanius 
ludovicianus). A total of 1,228 images of five mammals and five birds were documented at Captain Jack 
Spring (#12). Mule deer dominated with 1,166 images recorded.  

Gold Meadows Spring (#18) had 251 images of six mammal and three bird species. Most of these were 
horses (75) and mule deer (72). Six images of Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elaphus) were also detected.

 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 At South Pah Canyon Tanks (#15), one mammal and two bird species were detected in 190 images with 
178 images of mourning doves. At Fortymile Canyon Tanks four mammal and two bird species were 
 detected in 74 images with 46 images of desert bighorn sheep. Only 34 images of five mammal species 
 were recorded at Topopah Spring including the first record of pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra 
 americana) using this spring (Figure 4-8). A mature buck was photographed at 2252 hours on August 27. 
 Only seven images of mule deer were recorded at Cane Spring but the camera was only operational 
 between September 10 and December 17.  

 4.4 CONSTRUCTED WATER SOURCE MONITORING 

 Nine constructed water sources were monitored with motion-activated cameras to document the presence 
of mountain lions and other wildlife during 2019. These included one well pond (Camp 17 Pond), five 
water troughs installed to mitigate the loss of well ponds, and three radiologically-contaminated sumps 
(Figure 4-9). 

Camp 17 Pond (#6) had the greatest species richness of any of the cameras in operation during 2019 with 
23 species (6 mammal, 17 bird) being photographed in 2,946 images (Table 6-5). Mule deer (1,573 
images), common raven (430 images), and feral horses (Equus caballus) (338 images) were the dominant 
species. Noteworthy observations include white-faced ibis (Plegadis chihi) (1 image) (Figure 4-10), 
black-necked stilt (Himantopus mexicanus) (10 images), and belted kingfisher (Megaceryle alcyon) 
(5 images). 

 4.4.1 Mitigating Water Loss for Wildlife 

 Water conservation measures were implemented on the NNSS in 2012 at four sites: Area 6 Construction 
 Yard (Area 6 Los Alamos National Laboratory [LANL] Pond), Well C1 Pond, Well 5B Pond, and J11 
 Pond. In order to conserve millions of gallons of water being lost to drainage and evaporation, pumping 
 water to fill these ponds was stopped. Wildlife observation data gathered over several decades 
 documented more than 100 species of wildlife using these artificial water sources. These included 
 carnivores, ungulates, rabbits, bats, and dozens of species of waterfowl, passerines, and other birds.  

 The drying of these ponds resulted in the loss of valuable wildlife habitat, so water troughs were installed 
 to help mitigate the loss. The water troughs were not meant to replace the well ponds as wildlife habitat, 
 but were meant to provide at a minimum some supplemental water in areas with very limited perennial 
 water sources and at sites where animals had become accustomed to finding water.  

 Water troughs were installed adjacent to the Area 6 LANL Pond and Well C1 Pond to mitigate the loss of 
 these ponds, at Well 5A (Well 5C) to mitigate the loss of the Well 5B Pond, and at Cane Spring and 
 Topopah Spring to mitigate the loss of the J11 Pond in Area 25. Motion-activated cameras were set up at 
 each trough during the fall of 2012 and have been monitored since then to document wildlife use. These 
 cameras were also added to the network of cameras used for monitoring mountain lions and results for 
 2019 are included in Table 6-5 (see Section 6.7.1, Motion-Activated Cameras).  

 Wildlife use at Well 5C trough (#24) was very heavy with the most images of all cameras on the NNSS 
 this year (5,781 images) with at least 16 species (6 mammals and 10 birds) photographed. Mourning 
doves dominated with 3,765 images followed by pronghorn antelope (726 images), burros (630 images), 
and common ravens (368 images). Noteworthy observations include loggerhead shrike (5 images) (Figure 
4-11), greater roadrunner (Geococcyx californianus), and yellow-headed blackbird (Xanthocephalus 
xanthocephalus).

 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 Wildlife use at the Well C1 Pond Trough (#10) was moderate (304 images) with five mammal and four 
 bird species detected. Burros (99 images) and mourning doves (95 images) were the most common 
 species photographed. Use at the other three troughs was light with 19 images of mule deer at Topopah 
 Spring Trough (#23), 17 images of one mammal and two bird species (mourning dove [12 images], 
 common raven [4 images], and mule deer [1 image]) at Cane Spring Trough (#8), and eight images of one 
 mammal and two bird species at Area 6 LANL Pond trough (#14) (pronghorn antelope [5 images], 
 mourning dove [2 images], and turkey vulture [Cathartes aura] [1 image]). 

 The number of animal photographs taken at Topopah Spring (n = 34) and the trough (n = 19) were similar 
 but species richness was greater at the spring (n = 5) than at the trough (n = 1). A similar pattern is evident at 
 Cane Spring comparing use from September 10 to December 17 when both cameras were working with 
 seven images of mule deer taken at the spring and zero images taken at the trough. This difference may be 
 due to a preference of some species for the natural setting of the spring, water availability and accessibility, 
 or a combination of both.  

 In summary, several wildlife species use the water troughs, indicating the troughs are benefiting many 
 wildlife species on the NNSS, especially certain bird species, ungulates, and coyotes. Waterfowl and 
 shorebirds do not appear to use the troughs and undoubtedly have been negatively impacted by the 
 removal of the well ponds. Although the water troughs did not replace the well ponds as a wildlife 
 resource, they still attract and benefit a multitude of wildlife species, especially during the hot, dry 
 summer. 

 4.4.2 Monitoring Wildlife Use at Potentially Contaminated Water Sources 
 During 2019, motion-activated cameras were set up at three contaminated water sources which are sumps 
constructed to retain groundwater and drilling fluids from Underground Test Area (UGTA) wells during 
drilling, well development, and groundwater testing. The sumps included those located at UGTA wells 
ER 20-7 (#13), ER 20-5 Upper (#2), and U19ad (#25) (Figure 4-9). The cameras were also added to the 
network of cameras used for mountain lion monitoring (see Section 6.7.1, Motion-Activated Cameras) 
(Table 6-5). Typically, d                                 ocuries/liter (pCi/L) of 
 tritium are diverted to plastic-lined sumps to evaporate; otherwise, they are diverted to unlined sumps. 
 Inactive well sumps can also retain precipitation, which can become contaminated from accumulated 
 sediments. The cameras were set up to document which wildlife species were using the sumps and their 
 frequency of use to assess the potential off-site transport of radionuclides by wildlife as well as the 
potential impact to the wildlife themselves.  

Overall, wildlife use at the contaminated sumps was light with ER 20-7 (#13) having the most use with 16 
images of four bird species recorded. Common ravens were the most common (11 images). Chukar, 
mourning doves, and a Say’s phoebe (Sayornis saya) were also detected at the sump. ER 20-5 Upper (#2) 
only had six images of passerine birds documented, and U19ad (#25) only had one image of an 
unidentified bird.  

A motion-activated camera was also set at E Tunnel Ponds, a perennial source of contaminated water 
flowing from E Tunnel, as part of another project (Ron Warren, personal communication). Mule deer 
(123 photos), elk (52 photos), mountain lions (11 photos), golden eagles (9 photos), bobcat (1 photo), 
coyote (1 photo) and numerous photos of other bird species, including mourning doves and chukar, were 
documented. 

Important species are using these sites and are potentially up-taking radiological contaminants. Hunt-able 
species such as chukar and mourning doves are a potential pathway of exposure to the general public. 
Protected birds such as golden eagles, common ravens, Say’s phoebes and most passerines may also be 
impacted. Contaminated water sources will continue to be monitored to determine their level of use by 


                                       46 
 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 various wildlife species, calculate the potential dose someone eating contaminated wildlife may receive, 
and determine if the dose is harmful to the animal. More information about potential dose to humans and 
wildlife can be found in the annual Nevada National Security Site Environmental Reports (e.g., MSTS 
 2019) available at

 4.5 COORDINATION WITH SCIENTISTS AND ECOSYSTEM MANAGEMENT 
     AGENCIES 

 Site biologists interfaced with other scientists and ecosystem management agencies in 2019 for the 
following activities: 
      Upon NNSA/NFO request, gave presentation about NNSS wildlife at the Consolidated Group of 
      Tribes and Organizations annual meeting in April. Provided them with numerous photos of 
      wildlife from Captain Jack Spring. 
      Accompanied U.S. Forest Service personnel in November and took photos of their plots for the 
      Interior West Forest Inventory and Analysis Program.  
      Participated in multiple conference calls for the Mojave Seeds of Success Program and collected 
      several samples of Indian ricegrass (Stipa hymenoides) and yellow cups from around the NNSS 
      for genetic testing. 
      Participated in multiple conference calls for the DOE Invasive and Endangered Species Working 
      Group. 
      Collaborated with Dr. Lee Dyer and Dr. Matt Forister (University of Nevada Reno) to develop 
      and submit a Site Directed Research and Development proposal entitled “Measuring 
      radionuclide-induced metabolomic and genomic shifts in plants to detect nuclear weapons testing 
      and characterize past nuclear events.” Collected silvery lupine (Lupinus argenteus) and freckled 
      milkvetch (Astragalus lentiginosus) samples for genomic testing. 
      Collaborated with Sasha Reed (U.S. Geological Survey) and others to establish a study site on the 
      NNSS for a Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program funded project entitled 
      “Forecasting Dryland Ecosystem Vulnerability to Climate Change: A Cross-Systems Assessment 
      of Vegetation and Process Responses to Disturbance and Climate Variability on DoD/DOE 
      Lands.” 
       Gave biologists from Southern Nevada Water Authority an ecological tour of the NNSS in 
       December.

 5.0  SENSITIVE AND PROTECTED/REGULATED PLANT MONITORING 

 The list of sensitive and protected/regulated plants on the NNSS (see Table 2-1) is reviewed annually to 
 ensure the appropriate species are included in the NNSS sensitive plant monitoring program. Taxonomy 
 in the field of botany is constantly changing based on new information obtained on the relationship of 
 plant species. In order to track these changes, MSTS biologists reviewed several widely accepted sources: 
 The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants of California (Baldwin et al. 2012), the NNHP, the NNPS, and the 
 U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) PLANTS database (USDA, 2020), as well as attending meetings 
 and workshops with other local botanists. 

 The working list of over 850 plant species identified on the NNSS was reviewed with the 2020 NNHP 
 At-Risk Plant and Animal Tracking List (NNHP List) to determine if any updates are needed to the NNSS 
 sensitive plant monitoring program. Four plants currently not listed on the NNSS sensitive plant 
 monitoring program, but listed on the NNHP List will be evaluated to determine their NNSS sensitive 
 plant species ranking, if warranted: Clokey’s cryptantha (Cryptantha clokeyi), Lahontan beardtongue 
 (Penstemon palmeri var. macranthus), Nye milkvetch (Astragalus nyensis), and sand cholla (Grusonia 
pulchella formerly Opuntia pulchella). The Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia), which was under evaluation in 
2019, will be removed from the evaluation list and not added to the NNSS sensitive plant monitoring 
program based on updated information provided by FWS. 

A review of past monitoring surveys, known and historical populations, and the database of the sensitive 
plant species on the NNSS began in 2019. The NNSS’s Adaptive Management Plan for Sensitive Species 
on the Nevada Test Site (Bechtel Nevada 2001) and MSTS’s Organization Procedure titled Monitoring 
Sensitive Plant Species lay out monitoring, management and goals for sensitive plant protection. These 
procedures include maintaining updated data, maps, and fact sheets on each plant. This updated 
information for each plant will be completed in 2020 and include the following: known population 
locations and size on the NNSS, range wide distribution, herbarium collections, monitoring surveys, 
known habitat, known threats and photos. 

 5.1 SPECIES EVALUATIONS 

 5.1.1 Clokey’s cryptantha (                 ) 

 Clokey’s cryptantha was added to the NNHP List in January 2019. Previously known to be endemic to 
 California, this species was found in Nevada in 2016 in Perlite Canyon, just east of Beatty. The species 
 was possibly found on the NNSS in 40-Mile Canyon near ledges located in the general area of 
 555466mE, 4087150mN (UTM NAD83). This area was searched in May 2019, just after its bloom period 
 in April. One specimen was collected at the base of a rock face and analyzed under a microscope. Based 
 on Simpson and Hasenstab (2009), the nutlets and branching structure of the specimen matched a more 
similar species, Nevada cryptantha (Cryptantha nevadensis). 

Clokey’s cryptantha was discussed during the Nevada Rare Plant Workshop hosted by the Nevada Native 
Plant Society in October 2019. Few attendees were familiar with the plant but it was noted that the plant 
grows on steep slopes, alongside several similar Cryptantha species, making it difficult to identify in the 
field. It is recommended that the off site location in Perlite Canyon be visited during the bloom period to 
aide in identifying potential habitat and comparisons to other Cryptantha annuals. 

Without confirmation that Clokey’s cryptantha occurs on the NNSS, it will not be added to the NNSS 
sensitive plant monitoring list. Occurrences on and off the NNSS will continue to be evaluated to 
determine if the plant does grow on the NNSS.

 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 5.1.2 Joshua tree (              ) 

 The Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia and Y. jaegeriana) was petitioned in 2015 to be listed under the 
 Endangered Species Act (ESA). This petition was reconsidered in 2018 and evaluated by FWS. On 
 August 14, 2019 the Carlsbad Fish and Wildlife Service Office released their findings that the Joshua tree 
 does not require protection under the ESA with the following statement: 

 “Most habitat occupied by the two species is federally-managed by agencies including the National Park 
 Service, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and Department of Defense. A much smaller 
 portion of habitat is managed by state or local governments or is privately owned. Species distribution 
 mapping shows there has been no major reduction or contraction in Joshua tree populations during the 
last 40 years. Additionally, several federal agencies, the states of California and Arizona and several 
local jurisdictions have adopted and implemented policies that provide some protections to Joshua trees 
from harvesting and removal” (FWS 2019-1). 

The evaluation by FWS was discussed during the Nevada Rare Plant Workshop hosted by the Nevada 
Native Plant Society in October 2019. It was suggested the southern range of the Joshua tree in 
California, namely Joshua Tree National Park, is where population declines have been documented and 
warrants further research. With the NNSS located within the northern distribution range and the continued 
efforts of MSTS biologists to recommend construction projects avoid Joshua trees, Y. brevifolia will not 
be included in the NNSS sensitive plant monitoring plan, but will remain as a protected/regulated species 
(Table 2-1). 

 5.1.3 Lahontan beardtongue (                   var.            ) 

 There are three varieties of Palmer’s penstemon (Penstemon palmeri) found in the western United States: 
 scented beardtongue (P. palmeri variety [var.] eglandulosus), Palmer’s penstemon (P. palmeri var. 
 palmeri) and Lahontan beardtongue. Scented beardtongue is not found in Nevada while the other two do 
 occur in Nevada and are very similar and overlap in distribution. A key to the three varieties can be found 
 in Cronquist et al. (1984). 

 Lahontan beardtongue is a Nevada endemic perennial subshrub with large, pale lavender tubular flowers. 
 It is listed on the NNHP List and has been found in Churchill, Nye, Pershing, and White Pine counties in 
 Nevada. Palmer’s penstemon is wide spread throughout the western United States from lower to upper 
 elevations and is not considered an at-risk, rare or sensitive plant. Lahontan beardtongue is distinguished 
 from Palmer’s penstemon by its longer corolla tube (cylindrical, hollow base of flower) and its often 
 sessile upper leaves (not fused surrounding the stem). 

 Palmer’s penstemon has been documented and collected on the NNSS, but the variety has not been 
 distinguished as Palmer’s penstemon or Lahontan beardtongue. There are 11 herbarium specimens 
 collected from the NNSS; nine are housed at the NNSS herbarium and two at the Wesley E. Niles 
 Herbarium at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Collection dates range from 1959 through 1978, 
 which make most of the specimens difficult to use for identification. One herbarium specimen collected 
 by J.C. Beatley on April 26, 1959 “growing 1-2 miles west of Camp Mercury” shows the characteristic 
 leaves of Lahontan beardtongue. 

 Palmer’s penstemon occurrences were recorded during ELU surveys from 1996 through 1998. It was 
 observed in eight different ELUs, but the variety was not identified. Occurrences were documented 
 throughout the NNSS at lower, mid and upper elevations (NNSS Operational Areas 19, 22, 26, 27 and 29; 
 refer to Figure 2-1 for Operational Areas). 


                                       49 
 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 Based on the locations and habitat descriptions of the known occurrences of Palmer’s penstemon on the 
 NNSS, it is possible both varieties grow on the NNSS. It is recommended that known locations be visited 
during the plant’s bloom period (May through July) to determine taxonomy. Specimens should be 
collected, pressed and accessioned into the NNSS herbarium. If needed, specimens shall be sent to a 
specialist for identification. Without confirmation that Lahontan beardtongue occurs on the NNSS, it will 
not be added to the NNSS sensitive plant monitoring list. Occurrences on the NNSS will continue to be 
evaluated to determine if the plant does grow on the NNSS. 

 5.1.4 Nye milkvetch (                  ) 

 Nye milkvetch is a small, herbaceous annual thought to be extirpated from southern Frenchman Flat in 
 Area 5 by construction activities (Beatley 1977). The plant is listed on the NNHP List and is found in 
 Clark, Lincoln, and Nye counties in Nevada. The species has also been documented in eastern California, 
 southwestern Utah and northwestern Arizona. The plant was first identified and collected in 1941 in 
 southern Frenchman Flat on the NNSS. Up until 1978, the plant was thought to be extirpated from the 
 NNSS with the assumption that development of several gravel pits disturbed the type locality population 
 (Rhoads and Williams 1977, Rhoads et al. 1979). Surveys conducted in April and May in 1978 by EG&G 
 Energy Measurements Group found Nye milkvetch in two areas of southern Frenchman Flat, one of 
 which was at the existing gravel pits (Figure 5-1). These findings were reported in January 1979 in an 
addendum to a report published in 1977 (Rhoads and Williams 1977, Rhoads et al. 1979). One survey 
 data form from May 1995 stated, “some Nye milkvetch plants” were found during a survey for a different 
 sensitive plant species, Parish’s phacelia (Phacelia parishii), at the same gravel pits (Figure 5-1). This 
 was the last documented survey for Nye milkvetch that could be found on the NNSS. 

 There are no specimen collections of Nye milkvetch in the NNSS herbarium. Several collections were 
 made during the 1978 surveys and are housed at the New York Botanical Garden herbarium. Collection 
 information can be obtained from the Intermountain Region Herbarium Network website 
 (http://intermountainbiota.org/portal/index.php). 

 There is a specimen in the NNSS herbarium, collected by J.C. Beatley in 1964, originally described as 
 A. acutirostris which was later annotated by Barneby as A. nyensis. It was then re-described by Beatley as 
A. didymocarpus var. dispermus (Rhoads et al. 1977). Nye milkvetch is closely related to several similar 
 species, which can make it easily overlooked in the field. Careful attention is needed to distinguish it from 
 A. didymocarpus var. dispermus, A. acutirostris, and A. nuttalianus var. imperfectus (Mozingo and 
 Williams 1980). 

 The conservation of this species was noted during the Nevada Rare Plant Workshop hosted by the Nevada 
 Native Plant Society in October 2019. It was discussed that the plant is fairly widespread throughout its 
 range but there are less than thirty known locations in Nevada, most found east of the NNSS on Wildlife 
 Refuge Land. In 1995, Nye milkvetch was not considered a sensitive plant by FWS and was not included 
 on the NNSS sensitive plant species list at that time (W.K. Ostler, personal communication, April 2020). 
 With the type locality found on the NNSS and the last observations in 1995, this plant’s sensitive plant 
 ranking on the NNSS shall be evaluated by conducting surveys and collecting specimens for 
 identification. If needed, specimens shall be sent to a specialist for identification. Nye milkvetch will be 
 added to the NNSS sensitive plant monitoring list with ranking status as “evaluate”. More information is 
 needed to assess the distribution and abundance of this plant on the NNSS.

 5.1.5 Sand Cholla (                 ) 

 Sand cholla is a cactus species on the NNHP List and is known to occur on the NNSS (Figure 5-2). In 
 2019, evaluation and surveys for this species began to determine if it warrants adding to the NNSS 
 sensitive plant monitoring list. Five known locations were visited in July (Figure 5-3). Although similar 
 cholla cactus species were observed at the locations, sand cholla was not found. Sand cholla is a small 
cactus, growing less than ten inches tall, and is known to grow under the canopy of other shrubs, making 
it difficult to see (Poulson 2017). Presence of sand cholla at these locations has not been ruled out and 
require surveys during its bloom period in June. 

At one visited location in Area 6 (Figure 5-3, Location 1), sand cholla was found east of the surveyed area 
during a pre-activity survey for a construction project. This area is now cleared of vegetation from the 
construction of a batch plant. A second plant was observed at a project site in Mid Valley in Area 16 
during a pre-activity survey (Figure 5-3). If the project proceeds, the area will be cleared of vegetation. If 
the project will not be able to avoid the plant, biologists recommend an attempted relocation of the plant. 

Opportunistic sightings of three sand cholla plants may have been found just off site, west of Area 22 on 
Bureau of Land Management land (Figure 5-3). Plants were all found in shallow wash bottoms at a slight 
(1-10%) east facing slope in Creosote-White bursage habitat (Larrea tridentata-Ambrosia dumosa) in the 
open. The locations should be revisited during the bloom period for identification. 

Due to the disturbance of the plant’s two known locations in 2019, it is recommended that sand cholla 
continue to be surveyed and its distribution be evaluated to determine its NNSS sensitive plant species 
ranking. It is recommended that surveys of past known locations be visited during the plant’s bloom 
period in June.

 5.2 LONG-TERM MONITORING 

 As part of the Adaptive Management Plan for Sensitive Plant Species (Bechtel Nevada 2001), the status 
 of each sensitive plant is monitored periodically to ensure NNSS activities are not impacting the species. 
 Field surveys are conducted to verify previously reported locations, to better define population 
 boundaries, and to identify potential habitat for sensitive plant species known to occur on or adjacent to 
 the NNSS. In 2019, several known plant populations were visited in order to familiarize new MSTS 
 biologists with species identification and determine recent threats, if any, to the populations. 

 5.2.1 Black woollypod (                   ) 

 Black woollypod is a small, low growing milkvetch in the Fabaceae (pea) family (Figure 5-4). It is also 
 known as the Funeral Mountain milkvetch, identified from the Funeral Mountains in Death Valley, 
 California. It is distinguished by dense, sometimes wavy, short hairs covering the leaves and fruit as well 
 as black hairs covering the base of the flowers. It is a rare plant with its distribution ranging from 
 “Nevada to California, along the east-west corridor of the transition desert” (Blomquist et al. 1995). On 
 the NNSS it is known from two locations: Shoshone Mountain in Area 25 and French Peak in Areas 6 
 and 11. Its habitat is photographed in Figure 5-5. 

 Two of the French Peak populations on the west side of the peak were visited on May 2, 2019. Healthy 
 plants were found at both known populations as well as a few plants observed westward downslope, 
 which were thought to have been the result of seeds washing down the canyon (Figure 5-6). Many plants 
 were found outside the known distribution for the southern-most west French Peak Population 
 (Figure 5-6). Most plants were past flowering with matured fruits (Figure 5-5), with some plants 
pre-flowering in the vegetative stage. Although caterpillars were observed on some plants, no herbivory, 
disease or disturbances were observed as threats to the populations. 

Black woollypod grows on “steep hillsides composed of ash-flow volcanic tuff that is typically light gray 
to reddish-brown” (Blomquist et al. 1995, Hinrichs and McKay 1965). The French Peak populations’ 
habitat is shown in Figure 5-5 with substrate shown in Figure 5-4, and described by MSTS geologist 
Heather Gang: 

“The habitat is located at the south end of Yucca Flat, on the northern flanks of the Massachusetts 
Mountains.  This part of the Massachusetts Mountains comprises mainly non-welded to welded, Miocene 
rhyolitic ash flow tuffs of the Topopah Springs and Rainier Mesa Tuffs, with lesser amounts of air-fall tuff 
(Hinrichs and McKay 1965). These rocks are exposed in places, but are more commonly covered by a 
thin layer of gravelly colluvium.  Lower on the slope within the habitat, thicker alluvium forms the apices 
of small alluvial fans.”

5.2.2 Cane Spring Suncup (                      ) 

The Cane Spring suncup (Chylismia megalantha) is a large annual that blooms in the fall with a showy 
pink flower and large foliage. The plant grows well on steep slopes and disturbances, including manmade 
disturbances. It is previously known from five areas on the NNSS and with completion of monitoring 
surveys in 2019, a sixth location was confirmed: Cane Spring, French Peak, Slanted Butte, Little Skull 
Mountain, Orange Blossom Road, and new location Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Complex 
(RWMC) (Figure 5-7). A similar species, Shockley’s evening primrose (Chylismia heterochroma), is a 
smaller version of Cane Spring suncup with differences in the flower at peak maturity. These two species 
are very similar and overlap in distribution, making the flower at peak maturity essential for positive 
identification. 

Pre-activity surveys at the Orange Blossom Road and French Peak populations were conducted in 2019 in 
July and August, respectively. Cane Spring suncup is known to grow along Orange Blossom Road in 
Area 6 (Figure 5-7). The road shoulders were to be bladed to accommodate chip and sealing of the road. 
No plants were found during this survey nor during the monitoring survey in 2018.

 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

 The French Peak population is known to grow along steep slopes just west of French Peak, near an 
 explosives facility. The road and pads for the facility, which are outside the known population, were to be 
 bladed for access in 2019. During the survey, close to 250 plants were observed, some along the road and 
 others just off the road in an area not scheduled for disturbance. The size of the petals and height of the 
 plants resembled Cane Spring suncup but identification could not be confirmed due to the timing of 
 construction occurring prior to peak flower maturity. Upon review of the French Peak population, it is 
 possible this population ranges further than what has been recently mapped. An old population map 
 showed this population to be significantly larger, ranging from the road and pads of the facility, north to 
 the steep slopes west of French Peak and east up to French Peak (Figure 5-8). There have also been 
 several collections outside these mapped areas which have not been confirmed as Cane Spring suncup or 
 Shockley’s evening primrose (Figure 5-8). 

 During a pre-activity survey in 2001, an unidentified Chylismia species, which could have been Cane 
Spring suncup, was found just northeast of the RWMC in Area 5. An opportunistic visit to the area 
revealed Chylismia plants were growing in the summer of 2019. A return visit for a survey in July found 
approximately 300 Cane Spring suncup plants growing along a manmade berm and a flat disturbed, 
connected area just north of the berm (Figure 5-7 and 5-8). The plants were identified based on petal size, 
plant size, and the diagnostic stigma protruding past the anthers at peak maturity (Figure 5-9). The stigma 
is even with the anthers at peak maturity on Shockley’s evening primrose. The area was heavily invaded 
by invasive species, which did not hinder the growth of Cane Spring suncup (Figure 5-9). 

Blomquist et al. (1995) stated “Observations made during surveys on [NNSS] conducted from 1991 to 
1994 indicate that there is no clear geographic separation between the two species on [NNSS]”. This 
publication further explains the difficulties of separating these two species as several collections from the 
NNSS that were previously identified as Cane Spring suncup were annotated in 1994 as Shockley’s 
evening primrose, and vice versa. 

 5.2.3 Pahute green gentian (                 ) 

 Pahute green gentian has a limited distribution and is endemic to Nye County in Nevada. On the NNSS, 
 Pahute green gentian grows along the southern rim of Pahute Mesa in Area 19 and southwest of Gold 
 Meadows, just north of Rainier Mesa in Area 12. It was first collected at its type locality in 1970 on the 
 NNSS by Janice Beatley, as described by J. L. Reveal (1971), along the southeastern-most edge of Pahute 
Mesa. This herbaceous perennial can be distinguished within the Gentianaceae family by its white-
margined basal leaves and its unique greenish-white to cream or very pale blue, flecked with dark purple 
flowers (Blomquist et al. 1995, Morefield 1992). 

There are seven monitoring locations on the NNSS; six on Pahute Mesa and one near Gold Meadows. 
The Gold Meadows population in Area 12 was visited on June 4, 2019 (UTM NAD83 568950mE, 
4119411mN). This population was last surveyed in 2008. A healthy population of approximately 2,500 
plants was observed within the 0.3-ac surveyed plot. A majority of plants (60%) were in flower. No 
threats to the plants were observed including herbivory, disease or disturbances.

           distribution of Cane Spring suncup and its smaller relative, Shockley’s evening 
           primrose (UTM [Zone 11, meters], NAD83).

 5.2.4 Sanicle biscuitroot (                 var.            ) 

 There are two varieties of Sanicle biscuitroot that occur on the NNSS; Cymopterus ripleyi var. 
 saniculoides (listed on the NNHP List) and C. ripleyi var. ripleyi (a more widely distributed species not 
considered at-risk). C. ripleyi var. saniculoides has purple flowers and grows along drainages in sandy 
washes at lower elevations on the NNSS (Figure 5-10). C. ripleyi var. ripleyi has white flowers and grows 
 “along sandy slopes, or in shrub interspaces, with no apparent affinity for washes or drainages” at higher 
 elevations on the NNSS (Hansen et al. 2010). The two varieties are not included in The Jepson Manual: 
 Higher Plants of California (Baldwin 2012) nor the USDA PLANTS database (USDA, 2020) but are 
 widely accepted by NNHP and NNSS botanists as separate taxa. After a thorough review and surveys of 
 both plants, Hansen et al. (2010) stated that, “Based on the lack of evidence that both varieties of 
 C. ripleyi are occurring at the same location and the unique habitat preference for both varieties, C. ripleyi 
 var. saniculoides will continue to be considered a valid taxon and will be monitored along with other 
 sensitive plants known to occur on the [NNSS].” 

 With above average winter precipitation and an extended bloom into summer months, it was a good year 
 for Sanicle biscuitroot in 2019. Monitoring surveys were completed at the Slanted Butte and Yucca Flat 
 populations as well as several opportunistic observations in Rock Valley in Areas 22 and 27. 

 The Yucca Flat population located near the intersection of Mercury Highway and Pahute Mesa Road in 
 Areas 1 and 3 (UTM NAD83 584337mE, 4099902mN) was visited in March. Eleven immature plants (in 
 the beginning vegetative state and not flowering) were observed. Evidence of herbivory was observed on 


                                       60 
Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

other plants in the area, but not Sanicle biscuitroot The Slanted Butte population located along Papoose 
Road in Area 9 (UTM NAD83 591817mE, 4108756mN) was visited in March. Six immature plants were 
observed. There were many annuals growing in the area as well as a few Joshua trees in bloom. Had this 
site been visited later in the spring, more plants may have been observed. Both the Yucca Flat and Slanted 
Butte populations that were surveyed were not in bloom, therefore the flower color could not be recorded. 

Opportunistic sightings in 2019 of C. ripleyi var. saniculoides in Rock Valley in Areas 22 and 27 led to 
additional surveys in the area, which resulted in the discovery of two new populations and the expansion 
of three known populations (Figure 5-11). It is possible all sandy washes in this area are potential C. 
ripleyi var. saniculoides habitat. The two new population locations were confirmed as C. ripleyi var. 
saniculoides by observing the plant’s purple flowers that bloomed in April. 

During annual wildland fire fuel surveys, C. ripleyi var. saniculoides was found at survey point 127 in 
Area 2 (UTM NAD83 582752mE, 4111804mN). This is a known location for this plant in northern 
Yucca Flat. The number of plants observed was not recorded.

 5.2.5 Weasel phacelia (                 ) 

 Weasel phacelia (Phacelia mustelina) is a widely distributed, small annual plant with a violet flower and 
a strong, disagreeable odor. The plant was given the ranking of “marginal” in the 2012 EMAC report as 
“It does not occur in large numbers but does occur over most of the NNSS as well as at many locations 
 off the NNSS” (Hall et al. 2013). The plant is listed on the NNHP List and the NNSS sensitive plant 
 monitoring list but has few threats on the NNSS. 

 One location that Weasel phacelia grows is on the steep southwest slopes of Skull Mountain in Area 25. 
 This population overlaps with another sensitive plant species, Beatley scorpionflower (Phacelia 
 beatleyae) (Figure 5-12, UTM NAD83 569324mE, 4065770mN). This location was visited in April 2019 
with the intent to document Beatley scorpionflower which was not found, but at least 200 Weasel 
 phacelia plants were found. The plants were not in bloom, but displayed the plant’s characteristically 
 irregularly toothed, hairy leaves (Figure 5-12). As only a small area was surveyed, it is assumed many 
 more plants would have been observed at a later visit.

 5.2.6 Rock purpusia (               var. saxosa) 

 In 2018, MSTS biologists collected leaf and seed samples of Rock purpusia (Ivesia arizonica var. saxosa) 
 to contribute to genetic research on Rock purpusia varieties. This variety is identified by its five separate 
 white petals. In 2019, a Silent Canyon population on Rainier Mesa in Area 19 was visited in August to 
 collect a pressed specimen of the plant for the same study (UTM NAD83 554253mE, 4123453mN). The 
 plant was found locally abundant throughout rock crevices along a power line road. It was a healthy 
 population with no apparent threats. Two plants were collected, pressed, and sent to the Department of 
 Biology, University of Nevada in Reno.

5.3 COORDINATION WITH OTHER SCIENTISTS 

      MSTS biologists continue to attend the Nevada Native Plant Society Southern Chapter monthly 
      meetings, when available. The meetings host a network of botanists familiar with Nevada native 
      plants. The meetings focus on current information and updates in southern Nevada related to the 
      status of important plant species, botany networking events and the need for collaboration 
      between government agencies on plant research. An MSTS biologist presented at the February 
      2019 meeting on the Status of Sensitive Plant Species on the NNSS in Las Vegas, Nevada. This 
      same presentation was presented at the April 2019 Northern Chapter meeting in Reno, Nevada. 

      An MSTS biologist attended a workshop on plant identification hosted by the Friends of the 
      Jepson Herbarium in U.C. Berkeley, California in May 2019. The workshop provided hands-on 
      experience with keying out plants using the newest edition of The Jepson Manual: Higher Plants 
      of California (Baldwin 2012). 

      MSTS biologists attended the Nevada Rare Plant Workshop in October 2019 hosted by the 
      Nevada Native Plant Society and the Nevada Natural Heritage Program in Las Vegas, Nevada. 
      The workshop allows botanist, government agencies and other interested parties to discuss 
      conservation priority of rare Nevada native plants. Two sensitive plant ranking lists were 
      discussed during the workshop: the NNHP List and the Nevada Native Plant Society List.

 6.0  SENSITIVE AND PROTECTED/REGULATED ANIMAL 
      MONITORING 

 The NNHP Animal and Plant At-Risk Tracking List (NNHP 2020); NAC 503, “Hunting, Fishing and 
 Trapping; Miscellaneous Protective Measures” (NAC 2020); FWS Endangered Species home page 
 (FWS 2020); and other sources were reviewed to determine if any changes had been made to the status of 
 animal species known to occur on the NNSS. The pinyon jay (Gymnorhinus cyanocephalus) was added as 
a sensitive species. The complete list with current designations is found in the Sensitive and 
Protected/Regulated Animal Species List (Table 2-1). 

Surveys of sensitive and protected/regulated animals during 2019 focused on (a) birds, (b) bats (c) feral 
horses, (d) mule deer, (e) pronghorn antelope, (f) desert bighorn sheep, and (g) mountain lions. 
Information about other noteworthy wildlife observations, the southeast Nevada pyrg (Pyrgulopsis 
turbatrix) conservation strategy, bird mortalities, and a summary of nuisance animals and their control on 
the NNSS is also presented. 

 6.1 BIRDS 
 Bird monitoring on the NNSS during 2019 focused on Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) Compliance, 
documenting bird mortalities, implementing the NNSS Avian Protection Plan, conducting winter raptor 
surveys, and a western burrowing owl radio-tracking study.   

 6.1.1 Migratory Bird Treaty Act Compliance 

 The MBTA is a federal law designed to protect most bird species. All but six birds known to occur on the 
NNSS are protected under the MBTA. Exceptions include the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), 
English house sparrow (Passer domesticus), rock dove or pigeon (Columba livia), and the Eurasian 
 collared dove (Federal Register, Volume 70, Number 49, March 15, 2005). The chukar and Gambel’s 
 quail (Callipepla gambelii) are also not protected under the MBTA but are regulated by Nevada state law 
as gamebirds. A change in the way the MBTA has been interpreted was written in a FWS Memorandum 
M-37050 on December 22, 2017. Up until now the MBTA has prohibited the intentional and incidental 
take of migratory birds. M-37050 changes that interpretation to state, “the Migratory Bird Treaty Act does 
not prohibit incidental take.” The impacts of this change are not known at this time but will be addressed 
as more information becomes available.  

Executive Order (EO) 13186 Responsibilities of Federal Agencies to Protect Migratory Birds directs 
federal agencies to develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and work with FWS to promote the 
conservation of migratory bird populations. An MOU was signed by DOE and FWS in September 2013 
regarding implementation of EO 13186. This MOU is currently being updated. 

Actions taken to comply with the MBTA and MOU during 2019 included the following: 1) conducted 
preactivity surveys for proposed projects before surface-disturbing work to avoid harming birds or their 
nests, 2) treated injured Say’s phoebe and released it and removed a common raven from an underground 
facility and released it, 3) installed bird guard, protective covers and other retrofits on power lines to 
reduce avian mortality, and 4) reported dead/injured birds to FWS. 

 6.1.2 Bird Mortalities 
 Bird mortality is a measure of impacts that NNSA/NFO activities may have on protected bird species. 
 NNSA/NFO activities that have affected birds typically have been of two types: electrocution and vehicle

 mortalities. Other causes of death include predation and disease and in many instances the cause of death 
 is unknown. Workers and biologists work together to observe and report mortalities. A total of 19 dead 
 birds were documented on the NNSS in 2019 (Figure 6-1). Fourteen (4 red-tailed hawks [Buteo 
 jamaicensis] and 10 common ravens) were electrocuted, one red-tailed hawk was found severely injured 
 due to unknown causes and was euthanized, one northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) was injured due to 
 unknown causes and died the next day, and three European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were found dead 
 due to entrapment. No golden eagle deaths were documented.     

 Numerous poles were identified by MSTS biologists and the power group to install retrofits or reconfigure 
 to make them avian friendly (Figure 6-2). A total of 157 poles were retrofitted or reconfigured during 
 2019. A variety of retrofits were made including installing insulator covers and extenders, perch deterrents, 
 conductor wire covers, and fuse covers. MSTS biologists also conducted surveys at 57 pole sets to assess if 
 they were avian-friendly and to look for bird carcasses. No dead birds were found and 10 (18%) were 
identified as not avian-friendly. These have been added to a list for future retrofit consideration.

 6.1.3 Implementing the NNSS Avian Protection Plan 

 The NNSS Avian Protection Plan (APP) was finalized during 2017. Its main purpose is to describe a 
 program intended to reduce the operational and avian risks that result from avian interactions with electric 
 transmission and distribution lines on the NNSS owned by NNSA/NFO as well as other non-electric 
sources of mortality (e.g., vehicle collisions, habitat disturbance).  

At the end of each calendar year the APP is reviewed and the following questions answered: 1) Is the 
reporting procedure effective at documenting avian mortalities, 2) Are reported mortalities/injuries 
addressed in a timely manner, 3) Are permit conditions being met, and 4) What mortality reduction 
measures were taken and are they effective. For 2019 answers to these questions are: 

       The reporting procedure was effective at documenting avian mortalities. There is good 
       communication between biologists, the power group, other NNSS workers and the Operations 
       Command Center to report avian issues. 

       Reported mortalities/injuries were addressed in a timely manner and were usually investigated the 
       same day or within a few days.  


                                       67 
 Ecological Monitoring and Compliance Program 2019 

       Currently, there are two federal permits and one state permit pertaining to birds on the NNSS. 
      Federal permit MB008695-2 allows the taking of up to 10 mourning doves each year for 
      radiological analysis and the salvage of dead migratory birds (except species listed under the 
      Endangered Species Act). All permit conditions were met and an annual report summarizing 2019 
      activities was submitted to FWS. No mourning doves were taken and no bird specimens were 
      salvaged for educational purposes. Federal permit MB60930C-1 is a “Special Purpose Utility 
      Permit – Electric,” and was issued November 6, 2018. This permit enables MSTS biologists to 
      remove active nests at project sites in emergency situations and possess and transport carcasses of 
      golden eagles and other bird species. All permit conditions were met and an annual report 
      summarizing 2019 activities was submitted to FWS. This included entering all bird mortality 
      injuries and mortalities into the Injury and Mortality Reporting system, a FWS electronic 
      database. Nevada Department of Wildlife (NDOW) Scientific Collection Permit 261454 allows 
      for the salvage and possession of migratory birds and the sacrificing of mourning doves, chukar 
      and gambel’s quail. All permit conditions were met and an annual report summarizing 2019 
      activities was submitted to NDOW. 

      Several mortality reduction measures were taken. These include the aforementioned retrofits on 
      157 power poles, identifying several poles for future retrofits, removing two inactive nests, 
      surveying 141 ha at 33 project sites for active bird nests, and removing several dead rabbits and 
      snakes from roads to reduce the potential for vehicle mortalities. These measures were effective 
      at reducing avian mortalities. 

 6.1.4 Winter Raptor Surveys 

 Winter raptor surveys were initiated during 2014, in an effort to better understand wintering raptors on the 
 NNSS and as a collaborative effort to provide data to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE) 
 nationwide mid-winter bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) survey and NDOW’s statewide monitoring 
effort. Surveys continued in 2019, and were conducted by driving a standard route to identify all raptors 
 observed (i.e., eagles, hawks, owls, and vultures). Two official routes were established on the NNSS: 
 Southern NNSS, Route #60 (83 kilometers [km]), and Yucca Flat, Route #61 (75 km) (Figure 6-3). Data 
 including common name, UTM coordinates (NAD 83), time, activity, age class, and perpendicular 
 distance from the road were recorded, and climatic data (i.e., temperature, wind speed, and cloud cover) 
 were taken at the beginning and end of each survey. Surveys were conducted January 8 (Southern NNSS) 
 and January 9 (Yucca Flat) to coincide with the national bald and golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) survey 
 and on February 18 (Southern NNSS) and February 12 (Yucca Flat).  

 The intent is for these surveys to be conducted each year for numerous years to look at long-term trends 
in winter raptor occurrence on the NNSS. Much is known about raptors on the NNSS in the summer, but 
winter data are lacking. Winter data may be important to detect changes in species composition related to 
climate change. Data on common ravens and loggerhead shrikes were also recorded because ravens are 
known desert tortoise predators, and the loggerhead shrike is a sensitive species. The southern route is 
located primarily in the Mojave Desert portion of the NNSS while the Yucca Flat route is located in the 
transition zone between the Mojave Desert and Great Basin Desert. Detailed driving directions for each 
route are found in the 2016 EMAC report (Hall et al., 2017). 

Results are found in Table 6-1. Only three golden eagle sightings were documented during the surveys; 
one each on the Yucca Flat route during the January and February surveys and one on the southern NNSS 
route during the January survey. This is quite a few less than last year’s total of 11 golden eagle sightings 
 across all surveys. The red-tailed hawk was the most common species detected on both routes, comprising 
 nearly two-thirds of all raptor sightings (Table 6-1). Common ravens were more prevalent on the southern 
route this year than in Yucca Flat with most of them observed near the Mercury Sewage Lagoons. Data

 6.1.5 Western Burrowing Owl Radio-tracking Study 

 The western burrowing owl is a National Species of Conservation Concern that has been declining in 
 certain parts of its range for many years. Western burrowing owls have been studied on the NNSS since 
 1996 (Steen et al. 1997, Hall et al. 2003, Greger and Hall 2009, Hall et al. 2009, Conway et al. 2010, Hall 
and Greger 2014) and much has been learned about their natural history and ecology on their summer 
range. Little is known about their migration ecology including where they spend the winter, migration 
routes, and stopover sites. This type of information is important to understand threats to this species 
during migration and on their wintering range.  

New technology has recently become available to use satellites and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to 
track western burrowing owls over vast areas to identify specific migration routes, important stopover 
sites and wintering areas. Lightweight (5 g), solar-powered, PTT transmitters (Microwave Telemetry, 
Incorporated) are light enough to attach to western burrowing owls and not exceed the general rule of 
adding no more than 5% of an animal’s body weight when attaching transmitters or other devices. 

In June, a collaborative study between MSTS, Dr. Courtney Conway (USGS, University of Idaho), and 
Carl Lundblad resulted in the capture of seven western burrowing owls. PTT transmitters were attached to 
each owl (Figure 6-4) as well as a FWS-approved leg band. Other data including age, sex, reproductive 
status, wing length, tail length and tarsus length were taken (Table 6-2). Owl locations were monitored 
periodically through December 31. In mid-October owls started migrating south. By mid-December one 
female (180445) was presumed to be near its capture location at the Big Explosives Experimental Facility 
in Yucca Flat, and its male (180443) mate was near the Salton Sea in southern California. Male (180446) 
and its female mate (180442) were on the west coast of Baja California, Mexico about 200 km apart. 
Female (180447) was last detected in Sheephole Valley, California in mid-October and appeared to still 
be moving and its male mate (174480) was just outside of Joshua Tree, California. Both are presumed 
dead or have shed their transmitters. Female (180444) was on the east side of Baja California, about 45 
km north of the Baja California Sur border (Figure 6-5). These results reveal wintering locations of NNSS 
owls for the first time with three migrating to Baja California and three to southern California. Coarse 
migration routes are shown by scattered dots (Figure 6-5). Figure 6-6 shows the capture locations (pink

 bird icons) and the distribution of the seven marked owls on and near the NNSS from capture until they 
 migrated. All but one owl (Female 180445) remained on or near the NNSS through mid-October.  

One (174480) transmitter had not moved for a while and it was assumed the owl was dead or the 
transmitter had become detached. On December 21, a MSTS biologist searched for the transmitter near 
Joshua Tree National Park but was unsuccessful in locating it. Mike Valmstad, a biologist from Joshua 
Tree National Park went out an additional four times searching for the transmitter with no success. No 
sign of the owl or the transmitter were found so it is unknown if the owl died or if the transmitter fell off. 
Owls will continue to be monitored as long as the transmitters are working to learn more about their 
migratory patterns, and additional owls may be captured and tracked in the future.

 6.2 BAT SURVEYS 

 Bat monitoring in 2019 consisted of removing bats from buildings and documenting the roost sites. Four 
 California myotis (Myotis californicus) were found under the roof of Building 23-160 during roof repairs 
 in early January. Two adult females were injured and had to be euthanized and two of unknown sex flew 
 away. One myotis species was found inside the new building in Mercury (23-460) and was released west 
of Mercury. One myotis species was found dead in a box car behind Building 23-651 and the carcass was 
properly disposed of. Roost site locations at these buildings were entered in the EGIS faunal database. 

 6.3  FERAL HORSE SURVEYS 

 Monitoring was conducted in 2019 to determine the abundance and distribution of feral horses on the 
 NNSS with survey routes, opportunistic sightings and camera traps (see Table 6-5 in Section 6.7.1 
 Motion-Activated Cameras). A previously-used, standard rubric for horse color, body features, body 
 markings, facial marking and leg markings was used to identify and count individual horses. Surveys were 
conducted during the spring and summer at several locations including Camp 17 Pond (Figure 6-7), Airport 
Road, Pahute Mesa Road, and Gold Meadows. Biologists identified 57 individuals in at least seven different 
bands; 17 females, 21 males, and 19 of unknown sex (Patty Hardesty, MSTS, personal communication, 
June 8, 2020). The total includes 9 juveniles and 6 foals. This is a substantial increase from 40 individuals in 
2018 with 6 new males and 10 new horses of unknown sex. Monitoring will continue to determine if this 
upward trend continues. 

Based on opportunistic sightings and camera results, horses were observed in the same areas as previous 
years. No horses were documented using Captain Jack Spring for the sixth consecutive year. Numerous 
horse photos were taken at Camp 17 Pond (338 images) and Gold Meadows Spring (75 images) 
(Table 6-5). These water sources are the core areas used by horses, especially during the hot, dry 
summer months.

 6.4 MULE DEER 

 Initial studies of mule deer at the NNSS were conducted by Giles and Cooper (1985) from 1977 to 1982 
 when they performed mark and recapture studies on about 100 marked deer. They estimated the 
 population to be about 1,500–2,000 deer. Spotlighting surveys for deer on the NNSS were conducted 
 during 1989–1994, 1999–2000, and 2006-2019. In past years, the monitoring effort has emphasized 
 estimating relative abundance and density but since 2016 survey efforts have focused solely on relative 
abundance. 

 6.4.1 Trends in Mule Deer Abundance 

 Mule deer abundance on the NNSS was measured by driving two standardized (59 km total length) road 
 courses (Figure 6-8) to count and identify mule deer. One route (29 km) was centered around Rainier 
 Mesa, and the second (30 km) was centered around the eastern portion of Pahute Mesa. Selection of the 
 two routes was based on information from Giles and Cooper (1985) who determined there are two main 
 deer herd components in these regions on the NNSS. Locations of mule deer were recorded with a 
 handheld GPS unit from the road centerline. Perpendicular distance from the road to each deer group was 
measured with a laser range finder. 

During six surveys conducted September 23-25 and October 7-9, 2019, a total of 119 deer were observed 
on both routes combined, which equates to an average of 19.8 deer per night. This is slightly higher than  
2018 results with 115 deer observed and an average of 19.0 deer per night. On average, this is about 
10 deer per night lower than the long-term average since 1989. There has been a decreasing trend 
(y = -2.2416x + 48.096, r2 = 0.56) the last 14 years with counts fluctuating widely (Figure 6-9). The trend 
 for the entire study period (1989-2018, excluding 1995-1998 and 2001-2005) is nearly flat (y = -0.1117x 
 + 31.364, r² = 0.0082). The standard deviation in 2019 for nightly counts was one of the lowest recorded 
since 2006 (Figure 6-9), and deer counts ranged from 12 to 30 deer per night. Specific causes for the 
fluctuation in deer numbers is unknown and requires further investigation.  

Unlike the last two years, the number of deer per 10 km was higher on Pahute Mesa than Rainier Mesa 
in 2019 (Figure 6-9). A total of 63 deer groups were detected. Group size varied from 1 to 7 animals. 
Average group size was nearly equal between the Pahute Mesa and Rainier Mesa routes (1.8 and 2.1, 
respectively).    
 6.4.2 Sex and Fawn/Doe Ratios 

 The deer sex ratio (number of bucks per 100 does) decreased from 105 in 2018 to 87 in 2019, which is 
 substantially lower than the average of 107 (2006-2019) (Table 6-3). These sex ratios have varied greatly 
 on the NNSS since 2006. Our values overall show some similarity to historical sex ratios noted by Giles 
 and Cooper (1985), who attributed the higher number of males to a lack of hunting on the NNSS. 
 Generally, deer populations in hunted areas in the western U.S. have significantly fewer males compared 
 to females in the population than measured on the NNSS. The fawn/doe ratio (number of fawns per 100 
 does) in 2019 was 21 in 2019 which is a little lower than the last two years (26) (Table 6-3) and the 
average of 25 for the period 2006-2019. The percentage of individuals unclassified to sex in 2019 was 
17.6% which is about the same as the average percentage of unclassified sex since 2006 (17.9%). When 
deer are observed at long distances (150-200 m) from the vehicle, it can be difficult to determine if 
individuals are bucks, does, or fawns due to spotlight limitations.

6.4.3 Fall Distribution Surveys 

A research study involving the capture and radio-collaring of mule deer on the NNSS to better understand 
their habitat use and movements was initiated in November 2019 (See 6.5 Mule Deer and Pronghorn 
Antelope Distribution Study). In order to locate mule deer and facilitate captures, spotlight surveys were 
conducted on November 13 on both the Pahute Mesa and Rainier Mesa routes. A total of 7 deer were 
observed (3 bucks, 2 does, and 2 unknown) on the Pahute Mesa route. Most of these were found near the 
Echo Peak area. Thirteen deer (3 bucks, 7 does, 1 fawn and 2 unknown) were observed on the Rainer 
Mesa route, all of which were on the eastern slope of Rainier Mesa at lower elevations.  

6.5 MULE DEER AND PRONGHORN ANTELOPE DISTRIBUTION STUDY 

Mule deer and pronghorn antelope are mobile game animals that inhabit the NNSS. Both are generally 
considered to be migratory with distinct winter and summer ranges. Mule deer typically prefer the 
forested, mountainous habitats in the northern and western portions of the NNSS while pronghorn 
typically prefer the open valleys in the southern and eastern portions of the NNSS. Gold Meadows on the 
northern NNSS boundary is one of the few places where mule deer and pronghorn regularly occur 
together during the summer. Mule deer are much more abundant than pronghorn on the NNSS. Mule deer 
movements on the NNSS were studied more than 30 years ago (Giles and Cooper 1985) using radio-
collars that required triangulating locations that lacked the accuracy of current GPS radio-collars. They 
identified summer and winter ranges and a couple of long distance movements of mule deer into areas 
where hunting is allowed on public land. Mule deer in their study were not necessarily those known to be 
using radioactively contaminated locations. Pronghorn are relatively new residents to the NNSS (first 
observed in 1991) and their use of the NNSS has never been studied but they are known to be widespread. 
Tsukamoto et al. (2003) report the distribution of pronghorn in Nevada as of 2002 with the nearest

 population to the NNSS being just north in Emigrant Valley. The NNSS represents an expansion of 
 pronghorn range in Nevada.  
 A research study involving the capture and radio-collaring of mule deer and pronghorn antelope on the 
NNSS was initiated in November 2019 to better understand the potential radiological dose to the off-site 
public via the hunter pathway. This was a true collaborative effort involving Kathy Longshore 
(Co-Principal Investigator, USGS), NDOW (Dr. Peregrine Wolff and Chris Morris [veterinarian support]; 
Joe Bennett, Pat Cummings and Cody Schroeder [game biologists]) and MSTS biologists. Native Range 
Capture Services (David Rivers, pilot and his crew) was contracted to capture the animals using net guns 
from a helicopter. NNSA/NFO and DOE Environmental Management Nevada Program graciously 
provided funding for the study. Study objectives included: 1) determine the distribution, abundance, and 
range of movements of mule deer and pronghorn, 2) estimate the potential for hunters to harvest mule 
deer and pronghorn which use the NNSS, 3) evaluate mule deer and pronghorn use of contaminated areas, 
4) obtain information on the potential radiological dose to someone consuming deer and pronghorn from 
the NNSS, 5) determine the potential radiological dose to mule deer and pronghorn on the NNSS, 6) 
document survival and causes of mortality for both mule deer and pronghorn, 7) refine habitat use 
 patterns for both mule deer and pronghorn using resource selection functions and correlate that with 
 phenological changes in the vegetation, and 8) assess the overall health, disease status, and genetics of 
 NNSS mule deer and pronghorn. 
 On November 15-17, the aforementioned collaborators along with several volunteers assembled to 
 capture the mule deer and pronghorn. Six staging areas (Figure 6-11) were used to capture animals from a 
variety of locations focusing on sites close to contaminated areas such as Yucca Flat, Frenchman Flat and 
E Tunnel Ponds. The intent was to bring as many animals as possible, especially pronghorn which are 
more susceptible to capture-related injuries, to the staging area for physiological monitoring and health 
assessments before they were released (Figure 6-12). In addition, radiological burden measurements using 
a direct count method were taken on several animals at the staging areas. A total of 23 mule deer (16 
does, 7 bucks) and 20 pronghorn (14 does, 6 bucks) were captured (Table 6-4). All 23 mule deer were 
radio-collared and ear-tagged. Ten of the animals were brought to a staging area (6 Area 19 Echo Peak, 4 
Area 12 E Tunnel Road) for processing and 13 were processed in the field at the capture location. 
Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD’s) were attached to 12 mule deer doe radio-collars to estimate 
external radiological dose. Eighteen pronghorn (12 does, 6 bucks) were radio-collared and ear-tagged, and 
TLD’s were attached to the collars of 8 does and 4 bucks to estimate external radiological dose. Of the 20 
pronghorn 17 were processed at a staging area (6 Area 5 Frenchman Flat, 11 Area 7 Yucca Flat) and 3 
were processed in the field. One yearling female died at the staging area and was neither radio-collared 
nor ear-tagged, and one female was ear-tagged but not radio-collared due to abrasions on the neck area. 
One pronghorn doe (705944) was mistakenly captured twice, once on November 15 when it was ear-
tagged but not radio-collared and again on November 17 when it was radio-collared. 
After capture, a radio-collar was carefully affixed around the neck, a unique combination of ear tags was 
attached (Figure 6-13) and the animal’s age, sex, and rectal body temperature were recorded (Table 6-4). 
Blood was also collected for disease, genetic, and radiological analyses (see Section 6.8 Radiological 
Sampling). Animals processed at the staging area had additional data taken including body weight, body 
condition score, and neck circumference (Table 6-4). Heart rate, respiration rate and eye, ear, and leg 
checks were also conducted to ensure the health of the animal before release.  
Radio-collars were programmed to record six locations per day at 4-hour intervals starting at midnight. 
Data are uploaded via satellite each day at approximately 0800 Pacific Standard Time. Radio-collars were 
programmed to be automatically released from the animal in November 2022. Figure 6-11 shows the 
capture locations and overall distribution of mule deer and pronghorn from capture through December 
31st, 2019. Mule deer were concentrated in the mid-elevation, mountainous regions while pronghorn were 
concentrated in Frenchman Flat and Yucca Flat. No long distance migration events were recorded during

 this time period. There were some movements of mule deer onto the Nevada Test and Training Range 
 (NTTR) north of Pahute Mesa and west of Timber Mountain, and some pronghorn moved onto NTTR 
east of Frenchman Flat.  
Two mortalities were documented after the captures. Two pronghorn does were killed/scavenged by 
coyotes within a couple of days of being captured. One doe (#705970) died around 0800 on November 
19th. The carcass was found on the Yucca Playa lakebed and the collar was found nearly 500 m west of 
 the carcass but still on the lakebed. This animal traveled a long distance to Frenchman Flat east of the dry 
 lakebed and back to Yucca Flat within 24 hours of dying, a distance of about 40 km. The other doe 
 (#705944) had been mistakenly captured twice. It died around 1600 hours on November 19th and was 
 found within 1.9 km of #705970. 
 Blood samples for 14 of the 23 mule deer and 18 of the 20 pronghorn were sent by NDOW to the 
 Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab where they were tested for Anaplasmosis (ELISA test), 
 Bluetongue (ELISA test), Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus (BRSV) (Virus Neutralization), 
 Parainfluenza Virus (PI-3) (Virus Neutralization), and Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD) (ELISA 
 test). Five mule deer tested positive for Anaplasmosis and one mule deer tested positive for PI-3. No mule 
 deer were positive for Bluetongue, BRSV or EHD. Four pronghorn tested positive for bluetongue and 
 four for EHD. No pronghorn were positive for Anaplasmosis, BRSV, or PI-3.   
 6.6 DESERT BIGHORN SHEEP 

 Prior to 2009, desert bighorn sheep (sheep) were rare visitors on the NNSS (Saethre 1994, Wills and 
 Ostler 2001, Hall et al. 2017). Since 2009, numerous observations of sheep and sheep sign (i.e., scat, 
 beds, and remains) have been detected with motion-activated cameras and during a recent mountain lion 
study, including the discovery of ewes and lambs in the Yucca Mountain/Fortymile Canyon area in 2011. 
 These new data expanded the known distribution of sheep on and near the NNSS and prompted the radio-
tracking study from 2015-2018. Results of this study were summarized in the 2018 EMAC Report (Hall 
and Perry 2019) and a comprehensive USGS Open File Report on the study is being finalized for 
publication. Conclusions from the radio-tracking study recommend continued monitoring of the NNSS 
sheep population. In 2019, this was done by documenting sheep use at several water sources using camera 
 traps. Also, at the end of the radio-tracking study, three animals (2 rams, 1 ewe) still had the radio-collars 
 attached due to an error during capture in which excess collar material was not cut off. In January and 
 February attempts were made to track these animals and assess the collar status. Only one animal was 
 observed (Ram 686328) and appeared to be fine. It was in the Beatty Wash area with several other rams 
 (Figure 6-14). 

 6.6.1 Camera Trap Results 

 During 2019, motion-activated cameras detected sheep at Delirium Canyon Tanks (820 images), 
Cottonwood Spring (365 images), Twin Spring (107 images), Fortymile Canyon Tanks (46 images), 
South Pah Canyon Tanks (11 images) (Table 6-5). A minimum of 15 individual sheep were detected at 
Fortymile Canyon Tanks. These included 5 marked sheep (Ewe 686318; Ewe 686314; Ewe 686318; Ewe 
I, E, or 120; and Ram 116 with collar) and 10 unmarked sheep (4 ewes, 2 lambs, 1 young ram, and 3 adult 
rams). At Cottonwood Spring, a minimum of 14 individual sheep were detected including 9 marked sheep 
(Ewe 686317, Ewe 686319 [Figure 6-15], Ewe 686318, Ewe 686315, Ewe 686320, Ewe 686314, Ram 
123, Ram J 686326, and Ram 686327) and 5 unmarked sheep (3 ewes, 1 young ram, 1 adult ram). Five 
marked sheep were detected at Delirium Canyon Tanks including Ewe 686316 with collar, Ewe 686318, 
Ewe 686319, Ewe 686313, and Ram 686328 as well as at least four unmarked adult ewes, one young ewe, 
and one young ram for a total of at least 11 individuals. A minimum of 4 individuals were detected at 
South Pah Canyon Tanks. These included 1 marked ewe (Ewe 686313) and 3 unmarked sheep (1 adult

ewe, 1 lamb, 1 young ram). Only rams were detected at Twin Spring including 3 marked rams (Ram 
686328, Ram116 with collar, and Ram J 686326) and 2 unmarked rams (1 young ram and 1 adult ram). 

Similar to 2017 and 2018, a total of 13 marked sheep were documented with camera traps at water 
sources. These included 8 ewes (6 captured in 2016 and 2 captured in 2015) and 5 rams (4 captured in 
2016 and 1 captured in 2015). In addition to the 13 marked sheep, a minimum of 11 unmarked sheep 
(4 adult ewes, 1 young ewe, 2 lambs, 3 adult rams, and 1 young ram) were also detected at the monitored 
water sources. Combined, a minimum of 24 sheep were documented at monitored water sources on the 
NNSS in 2019. Two sheep, Ewe 686316 and Ram 686328, still had the radio-collars attached.

 6.7 MOUNTAIN LION MONITORING 
 6.7.1 Motion-Activated Cameras 
 Few data exist for mountain lion numbers and their distribution in southern Nevada, including the NNSS. 
 Since 2006, site biologists have collaborated with Dr. Erin Boydston and Dr. Kathy Longshore, USGS 
 research scientists, to use remote, motion-activated cameras to determine the distribution and abundance 
 of mountain lions on the NNSS. Cameras used this way are referred to as camera traps. Remote, motion-
 activated cameras were used in 2019 at 25 sites (Figure 6-16 and Table 6-5). Sites were selected at 
locations with previous or new mountain lion sightings or sign, on roads or landform features that are 
potential movement corridors from one area to another, and in areas of good mule deer habitat (mule deer 
are a primary prey species for mountain lions). Some sites were also added based on other needs such as 
documenting the predator community in tortoise habitat or detecting animals at contaminated water 
sources or water troughs. The number of images reported is based on a 1-minute interval between images 
taken during a single episode. Some images reported herein were taken during late 2018 and early 2020 
due to the accessibility and scheduling of camera trap visits. Images for all locations, except Delirium 
Canyon Tanks, from December 2019 through early May 2020 were lost due to a computer hard drive 
issue. 

A total of 69 mountain lion images (i.e., photographs or video clips) were taken during 112,428 camera 
hours across all sites (Figure 6-16 and Table 6-5). This equates to about 0.6 mountain lion images per 
1,000 camera hours. Mountain lions were detected at seven of the 25 sites, including five water sources, 
one canyon, and one road (Figure 6-16). Table 6-6 contains the camera trap results by month and location. 
Figure 6-17 depicts two mountain lions at Fortymile Canyon Tanks.  

It is difficult to tell individual mountain lions apart from camera trap images and determine the exact 
number of mountain lions on the NNSS. At least three individuals (adult male, adult female with

 subadult) were documented in 2019 from the 25 camera traps. A camera trap from another project 
documented an adult female and three subadult cubs at E Tunnel Ponds. This makes a total of at least five 
individuals (adult male, adult female, 3 subadults) known to occur on the NNSS in 2019. This compares 
to a minimum of three individuals in 2018, four individuals in 2017, five individuals in 2016, three 
individuals in 2015 and four individuals in both 2014 and 2013. An adult mountain lion was also 
observed at E Tunnel Ponds on October 8 during mule deer spotlight surveys. 

In order to investigate temporal activity of mountain lions, camera detection data from all 14 years (2006–
2019) were combined. Mountain lions were detected every month with peak occurrences during June, 
(n = 110), August (n = 102) and November (n = 147) (Figure 6-18). The number of images taken during 
summer and fall (June–November) (n = 593) accounted for nearly two-thirds of all images compared with 
the number of images taken during winter and spring (December–May) (n = 295) (Figure 6-18). Nearly 
three-fourths of mountain lion images were taken between 1700 to 0500 hours (Figure 6-19). From 2011 
to 2019, nearly 1.6 times as many images were taken when it was dark (n = 429) compared with when it 
was light (n = 270). 

A secondary objective of the camera surveys is to detect other species using these areas and thus to better 
define species distributions on the NNSS. A total of 20,175 images of at least 52 species other than 
mountain lions were taken during 112,428 camera hours across all sites (Table 6-5) which is about 
179 images per 1,000 camera hours. This is the greatest species richness documented using camera traps 
in a given year and the highest number of images per 1000 camera hours by more than three-fold, and this 
in spite of the fact that little data was collected from January to early May.

 The most prevalent species photographed (22% of all images) was mule deer (4,372 images at 14 of 25 
sites). Captain Jack Spring (1,166 images), Camp 17 Pond (1,573 images), and Twin Spring (1,386 
images) are very important water sources for mule deer. Some of the rarer, more elusive species 
documented from camera surveys were desert bighorn sheep (see Section 6.7.1), bobcat (found at 10 of 
25 sites), gray fox (found at 5 of 25 sites), golden eagle (found at 4 of 25 sites), and badger (found at 1 of 
25 sites). Kit fox, LeConte’s thrasher (Toxostoma lecontei) and desert tortoise were documented at the 
Area 22, Juvenile GOAG Site 2 location. Noteworthy observations of some of the more common species 
included 343 images of coyotes at 11 of 25 sites and 875 images of common ravens at 9 of 25 sites. 
Greatest use and highest species richness was documented at water sources (both natural and constructed) 
which emphasizes the importance of various water sources for several wildlife species, particularly during 
the drier months.  

 6.8 RADIOLOGICAL SAMPLING 
 Sampling for radionuclides in game species (e.g., mule deer, pronghorn antelope) was performed in order 
to 1) determine uptake of radionuclides left over from previous nuclear testing on the NNSS, 2) estimate 
the potential dose to a human consuming a contaminated animal, and 3) estimate the dose to the animal. 
Sampling is to ensure dose limits, set to protect human and animal health, are not exceeded. These species 
are known to have large home ranges and may leave the NNSS and move into areas where hunting is 
allowed. This is a potential pathway for humans to receive a dose from radionuclides found on the NNSS 
and must be accounted for. 

In 2019, four tissue samples were collected opportunistically and analyzed, from one dead adult female 
bobcat and three roadkill antelope (one adult female and two adult males). In addition, tissue samples 
were taken from two captured antelope including a yearling female that died at the staging area and an 
adult female that died a few days after capture from coyote predation. Further, blood samples were taken 
from 20 captured antelope and 21 captured mule deer. Water was distilled from the tissue samples and 
submitted to a laboratory for tritium analysis. The remaining tissue samples were submitted for 
Strontium-90, Plutonium-238, Plutonium-239+240, Americium-241, and gamma spectroscopy analysis. 
Blood samples were analyzed for tritium and gamma-emitting radionuclides and 10 mule deer and 10 
antelope samples were also analyzed for Strontium-90, Plutonium-238, Plutonium-239+240, and 
Americium-241. 

Results revealed very low radionuclide concentrations as follows: Americium-241 in one of the road-
killed antelope, tritium in 85.7% of mule deer samples and in 65% of the antelope samples, Strontium-90 
in two antelope and one mule deer, and Plutonium 239-240 in two mule deer and one antelope. All of 
these concentrations are very low and do not present a hazard to the animal or a person eating them. For a 
more detailed analysis of specific radionuclides and dose assessments see MSTS (2020).  

 6.9 NUISANCE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS WILDLIFE 
 During 2019, MSTS biologists documented 40 calls regarding nuisance, injured, dead, or potentially 
 dangerous wildlife in or around buildings, power lines, and work areas on the NNSS. Problem, injured, or 
 dead animals included birds (21 calls), bats (4 calls), other mammals (7 calls), reptiles (6 calls, including 
 2 rattlesnakes), and invertebrates (bees, 1 call; spiders 1 call). Mitigation measures taken typically 
 involved relocating the animals away from people, instructing workers to leave the animal in place, or 
disposing of dead animals. 

Safety presentations were also given and sent out via employee communications to educate NNSS 
workers about some of the potential hazards NNSS wildlife pose and how to safely work to protect 
themselves and the animals that call the NNSS their home.

 6.10 ELK AND FERAL BURROS 
 Historic studies on the NNSS do not mention the presence of Rocky Mountain elk (Jorgensen and 
 Hayward 1965; Collins et al. 1982). Likewise, horses but not burros were mentioned by Jorgensen and 
 Hayward (1965). Collins et al. (1982) conducted a biologic overview of the Yucca Mountain area and 
 found that individual burros were occasionally observed near Cane and Topopah springs and documented 
 numerous burro droppings in the central section of Yucca Mountain along the major ridges and in the 
 eastern side canyons. They did not see any animals and concluded that burros used this area in winter and 
 spring when ephemeral water and succulent plants were present. Site characterization studies at Yucca 
 Mountain in the late 1980s and 1990s rarely documented burros and elk were not documented at all. 

 Saethre (1994) reported that Rocky Mountain elk are resident outside the NNSS and rarely observed on 
 the NNSS but did not document any specific sightings. Since 2009, there have been a few transient bull 
elk seen and photographed around Rainier Mesa and Pahute Mesa. Young bull elk are known to disperse 
from their natal range, and it is likely that the source population for the young bulls is to the north, 
possibly in the Groom or Kawich Range. During 2019, elk were photographed at Gold Meadows Spring 
six times between May 9 and August 9. Two elk were observed in the Gold Meadows area during feral 
horse surveys on June 11. One mature bull elk was photographed 52 times between September 13-15 at E 
 Tunnel Ponds. 

 Feral burros appear to be increasing in number and expanding their range on the NNSS. During 2019, 
 burros were documented with camera traps at Twin Spring (1,375 images), Well 5C trough (630 images) 
 and Well C1 Pond Trough (99 images) (Table 6-5). The area around Twin Spring was heavily disturbed 
from burro use with numerous trails on the hillslope around the spring. All burro photos at Twin Spring 
were taken in November, and numerous photos showed burros at the spring with mule deer and desert 
bighorn sheep.   

 6.11 COORDINATION WITH BIOLOGISTS AND WILDLIFE AGENCIES

 7.0 

 MSTS biologists have conducted revegetation activities at disturbances on and off the NNSS in support of 
 NNSA/NFO and DOE Environmental Management Nevada Program activities and continue to evaluate 
those efforts. Revegetation supports the intent of Executive Order EO 13112, “Invasive Species,” to 
prevent the introduction and spread of non-native species and restore native species to disturbed sites. 
Revegetation also may qualify as mitigation for the loss of desert tortoise habitat under the current 
Opinion. Activities conducted in 2019 included visually assessing the vegetation at the U-3ax/bl closure 
cover (CAU 110) and the “92-Acre Site” (CAU 111), overseeing and supporting the revegetation of Clean 
Slate II and Clean Slate III sites on the Tonopah Test Range, and preparing for the revegetation of Cell 18 
at the Area 5 RWMC.  

 7.1 CORRECTIVE ACTION UNIT (CAU) 110, U-3AX/BL, CLOSURE COVER 

 A qualitative assessment of the vegetation on CAU 110, U3-ax/bl closure cover was made on September 
 4, 2019. A meandering transect covering the entire cap was walked. The vigor of perennial plant species 
 was assessed based on current year’s growth, whether plants were flowering, and if any showed signs of 
 stress, i.e. dead stems or leaves. Shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) continues to be the most abundant 
 shrub species on the closure cover (Figure 7-1). None of the plants observed showed signs of stress, 
 however some dead shadscale plants were noted. Flowering plants were uncommon because of the time 
 of sampling. However, most of the shadscale plants were fruiting and had good seed production. There 
 was evidence of good seed production for Nevada jointfir, the second most common perennial species, as 
 well. The other shrubs occasionally encountered on the closure cover were winterfat and fourwing 
 saltbush. No perennial plant seedlings were seen. 

 No perennial grasses have been found on the closure cover for several years and none were found again 
 this year. Surprisingly, with the above-average precipitation, annual plant cover was quite low with 
 Esteve’s pincushion (Chaenactis stevioides) the most dominant annual. Bristly fiddleneck (Amsinckia 
 tessellata) and flatcrown buckwheat (Eriogonum deflexum) were also observed in low numbers. Invasive 
 species were minimal on the seeded portion of the cover cap with cheatgrass and saltlover (Halogeton 
 glomeratus) observed.  

During the vegetation surveys, small mammal activity on the CAU 110, U-3ax/bl closure cover was 
evaluated. Several burrow complexes were noted but not counted. There was activity around a few of the 
burrow entrances but many were not active. The number of burrows on the cover cap is far less than in 
the native undisturbed areas in Yucca Flat. The small mammal activity on the closure cover appeared to 
be about the same as last year. Trapping of small mammals is not recommended at this time. No rabbits 
were observed or evidence of herbivory on the vegetation. 

In summary, the vegetative cover on the CAU 110, U-3ax/bl cover cap appears to be stable and in very 
good condition. The plants on the cap showed good growth this year with many producing seed because 
of the increase in precipitation. Some dead shadscale plants were observed but this is to be expected as 
the plant community matures and due to the drought a few years ago. No perennial plant seedlings were 
observed which might be an issue. The annual forb component of the plant community was surprisingly 
low this year considering the above-normal precipitation. The area surrounding the cover which was not 
seeded continues to be covered with noxious weeds, primarily saltlover which highlights the importance 
of seeding to establish a perennial plant community.

 7.2 CAU 111, “92-ACRE SITE,” CLOSURE COVERS 

 A qualitative assessment of vegetation at the 92-acre site on September 4 found very few perennial plants 
 on any of the cover caps. There were about 20 large fourwing saltbush plants on the North South Cover. 
These plants were from the prior revegetation efforts that had survived the extensive rabbit herbivory 
before the site was fenced.  

Overall the integrity of the cover caps was very good. Weed densities were pretty high due to the 
abundant precipitation earlier in the spring and early summer with saltlover, Arabian schismus, and 
prickly Russian thistle (Salsola tragus) being the most common species (Figure 7-2). No rabbits or fresh 
rabbit sign were observed. Light rodent burrowing activity was detected. 

Several badger burrows were noted near the tribal revegetation plots in January. Most of the burrowing 
was around the existing large fourwing saltbush plants (Figure 7-3). The badger may have been trying to 
dig up rodents that had burrowed under the plants. During the September check no new badger burrows 
were found.

 7.3 CLEAN SLATE II (CAU 413) AND CLEAN SLATE III (CAU 414) 
     REVEGETATION 

 At the request of Navarro Research and Engineering, Inc., MSTS biologists provided input to a 
revegetation plan for the Clean Slate II (CAU 413) and Clean Slate III (CAU 414) cleanup sites on TTR 
during 2019 (Navarro 2019). MSTS biologists were also involved in site preparation and seeding 
activities. Due to a limited budget and constraints working inside a radiologically contaminated area, the 
original revegetation plans for these two sites (Anderson and Hall 1997, Hall and Anderson 1999) were 
revised and only included ripping the areas to be seeded, broadcast seeding a tailored mix of native seeds 
(Table 7-1) using a drill seeder, and then irrigating with a water truck.  

Site preparation and seeding occurred during the fall and early winter. After an area was seeded, irrigation 
was applied using a water truck. Revegetation monitoring to evaluate seeding success is planned for 
summer of 2020.

 7.4 AREA 5 RWMS, CELL 18 REVEGETATION PREPARATION 

 It is anticipated that Cell 18 at the Area 5 RWMS will be closed and revegetated during 2020. MSTS 
 biologists will be working with a subcontractor to develop a revegetation plan and then overseeing the 
 implementation of that plan. The revegetation strategy includes a combination of seeding and 
 transplanting. There is evidence that suggests seed collected from local sources as close to the 
 revegetation site as possible are best adapted to survive with a higher chance for successful establishment. 
Growing conditions during 2019 were favorable for seed production for several species. Multiple days 
were spent collecting white bursage, creosote bush, and Nevada jointfir seed. Seed was sent to a seed 
company for cleaning and testing. Some seed was given to the Nevada Division of Forestry who has the 
contract to grow 5000 transplants (2,500 white bursage, 2,500 creosote bush) and the remaining seed will 
be used in the seedmix to compare success from locally collected seed versus commercially available 
seed.
