39   Originality-Significance Statement

40   The direct assessment of ecophysiological processes, such as decomposition of

41   organic matter, is a key to understand the role of microbial communities in their

42   environment. We addressed this challenge by comparing information given by

43   genomes vs.  transcriptomes  of  two  fungi  during  a  litter  decomposition

44   experiment, in parallel with a measure of organic matter chemical changes. Our

45   findings  highlight  that  contrasting  ecological  strategies     were  reflected by

46   differences  in  expression  of  specific  functional  genetic  markers,  as      well as

47   temporal changes in gene expression of different components of the decomposer

48   machinery,  following  the chemical changes  in the  substrate  as decomposition

49   progressed.  Consequently,  we  assume  that  targeting  transcription  ratios  of
50   specific ‘keystone’ genes would be useful to assess fungal ecological strategies,

51   providing information about the dynamics of ecophysiological processes, such as

52   decomposition, at the ecosystem scale.

56   Summary

57   Microbial communities interplay with their environment through their functional

58   traits that can be as response or an effect to the environment. Here we explore

59   how a functional trait – the decomposition of organic matter, can be address

60   based  on  genetic  markers  and  how  the  expression  of  these  markers  reflect

61   ecological strategies of two fungal litter decomposer Gymnopus androsaceus and

62   Chalara longipes. We sequenced the genomes of these two fungi, as well as their

63   transcriptomes  at  different  steps  of  Pinus  sylvestris  needles  decomposition  in

64   microcosms. Our results highlighted that if the gene content of the two species

65   could indicate similar potential decomposition abilities, the expression levels of

66   specific  gene  families  belonging  to  the  glycosyl  hydrolases  (GH)  superfamily

67   reflected  contrasting  ecological  strategies.  Actually  C.  longipes,  the   weaker

68   decomposer in this experiment, turned-out to have a high content of genes

69   involved in holocellulose decomposition but low expression levels, reflecting a

70   versatile  ecology  compare  to  the  more  competitive  G.  androsaceus  with  high

71   expression  levels  of  keystone  functional  genes.  Thus  we  established  that

72   sequential  expression  of  genes  coding  for  different  components  of  the

73   decomposer machinery indicated adaptation to chemical changes in the substrate

74   as decomposition progressed.

81   Introduction

82   To  understand  relationships  between  composition  and  function  of  microbial

83   communities  it  is  essential  to  analyse  how  contrasting  ecological  traits  and

84   strategies interplay with the environment (Koide et al., 2014). Direct assessment

85   of  ecophysiological  traits  of  microorganisms  colonizing  natural  substrates  is  a

86   major challenge, but indirect approaches based on gene content and expression

87   offer new ways forward. Here we explore how fungal ecological strategies can be

88   assessed  based  on  genetic  markers  of  functional  traits (Kuske et  al.,  2015;

89   Treseder and Lennon, 2015), using two fungal decomposers of needle litter with

90   contrasting ecological strategies as a model.

91

92   During the past decades the number of sequenced fungal genomes has increased

93   rapidly,  especially  due  to  the Community  Science  Program        “1000  fungal

94   genomes” launched by JGI (Grigoriev et al., 2014). Genomic information enables

95   comparative analyses of fungal species, in order to explain functional differences

96   related to the content of genes with specific functions among genomes (Eastwood

97   et  al.,  2011;  Floudas et  al.,  2012;  Talbot et  al.,  2015;  Martino et  al.,  2018).

98   Organic matter decomposition is a good example where losses (Kohler et al.,
 99   2015)  and gains (Floudas et  al.,  2012;  Riley et  al.,  2014)  of  plant  cell-wall

100   degrading  enzymes  have  been  connected  to  the  evolution  of  specialized

101   ecological groups. Divergent evolution of the genetic machinery of decomposition

102   has led to the distinction of fungal guilds within the general guild of saprotrophs,

103   such as the white-rot fungi capable of lignin degradation (Floudas et al., 2012).

104   Consideration of different guilds of decomposers (e.g. opportunists, holocellulose

105   decomposers  and  lignin  decomposers)  may  enable  better  prediction  of

106   relationships between soil fungal communities, the chemical nature of organic

107   matter and the loss and stabilization of organic pools below ground (Moorhead

108   and Sinsabaugh, 2006; Talbot et al., 2015; Bhatnagar et al., 2018).

109

110   However, in relation to bacteria, fungi represent a narrow evolutionary branch,

111   and  it  seems  plausible  that  ecological  strategies  among  fungi  largely  reflect

112   differences in gene regulation rather than gene content. All genes involved in a

113   process may not be of the same importance, and ecological strategies could be

114   characterized  by  expression  of  certain  keystone  genes.  Further,  litter

115   decomposition  is biochemically sequential, and  a  transcriptomic approach can

116   provide information about the genes expressed during different phases of the

117   decomposition  process.  Fungal  gene  expression  in  response  to  the  chemical

118   composition of organic matter (Baldrian and López-Mondéjar, 2014), but also the

119   subsequent  alteration  of  organic  matter  by  fungal  gene  products  should  be

120   essential in defining the ecological strategy of fungal decomposers.

121

122   Fungal genes coding for enzymes involved in biochemical transformations during

123   decomposition are specified according to the CAZyme classification (Lombard et
124   al., 2014). The CAZy database characterizes evolutionary distinct enzyme families

125   with respect to their biochemical properties and substrate specificities. Enzymatic

126   degradation during litter decomposition can be divided into three main processes

127   linked to the principal components of plant cell walls: 

128       (1) Cellulose decomposition is a complex process resulting from the action of

129          a variety of glycoside hydrolases (GH) (Table1). Cellulases (primarily GH5-

130          5, GH6 and GH7) cleave cellulose chains, decreasing their length and

131          creating new chain ends. These enzyme can act on crystalline cellulose and

132          may  either  be  binding-releasing  enzymes  that  have  to  attach  to  the

133          cellulose  via  CBM  for  each  hydrolytic  cleavage  or  processive  (non-

134          releasing) enzymes that generate the dimer cellobiose (cellobiohydrolases)

135          (Payne et al., 2015). The 1,4-β-glucosidases (GH1 and GH3) then are able

136          to hydrolyze cellobiose into glucose. There is also an additional, oxidative

137          mechanism to cleave the cellulose internally, based on lytic polysaccharide

138          monooxygenases (LPMO), which belong the Auxiliary Activities (primarily

139          AA9) class of enzyme in the CAZyme database (Levasseur et al., 2013). 

140       (2) Hemicelluloses  are branched polymers that, in addition to glucose, also

141          contain  fucose,  galactose,  rhamnose,  mannose,  arabinose  and  xylose

142          (Sarkar et al., 2009; Schädel et al., 2010). Together these sugars form the

143          three  main  polysaccharides  of  hemicelluloses:  xylan,  xyloglucan  and

144          galactomannan.  Due  to  the  molecular  complexity  of  hemicelluloses,

145          several sets of enzymes are involved in their decomposition (Table1). The

146          involved  gene  families  are  polyspecific  and  contain  enzymes  that

147          potentially  may  target  many  different  substrates.  As  for  cellulose,

148          hemicellulose decomposition is initiated by endohydrolytic enzymes that
149          create  new  chain  ends,  enabling  the  subsequent  action  of  processive

150          exohydrolases followed by monomer-releasing enzymes. Pectins are also

151          heteropolysaccharides  that  are  degraded  in  a  similar  manner  as

152          hemicelluloses, with pectin lyases playing a key role.

153       (3) Lignin is a phenolic polymer that is resistant to hydrolytic decomposition.

154          Breakdown  of  lignin,  as  well  as  other  non-hydrolysable  components,

155          require  oxidative  mechanisms.  In  particular,  enzymes  in  the  class  II

156          peroxidase family (AA2) are able to attack a variety of chemical bonds in

157          an  unspecific  manner.  Class  II  peroxidases  include  lignin  peroxidases  ,

158          manganese peroxidases (MnP) and versatile peroxidases  (Martinez et al.,

159          2009; Hofrichter et al., 2010). Of these, MnP are the most abundant in soils

160          (Kellner et al., 2014)  and act indirectly by oxidizing Mn2+  to Mn3+, using

                                                   3+
161          H2O2  as  electron  acceptor.  The  Mn  ,  in  turn,  may  oxidise  a  variety  of

162          organic  molecules.  Multicopper  oxidases  (AA1),  including  laccases,  use

163          molecular oxygen as electron acceptor and have also been proposed to

164          participate in lignin oxidation.

165

166   The primary steps of decomposition are extracellular processes responsible for

167   the depolymerisation of long polymers into low molecular weight compounds that

168   may be taken up by the fungi and used in intracellular metabolism. Part of the

169   acquired resources will then be used in catabolism to eventually be released in


170   the form of CO2 during respiration via two steps of the citric acid cycle mediated

171   by isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and the oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex

172   (OGDC). Remaining resources may be used for anabolic purposes, building cell

173   components – primarily cell walls. The fungal cell wall is essentially composed by
174   two polymers; β-1,3-glucan, polymerized by glucan synthase (GT48), and chitin,

175   polymerized by chitin synthase (GT2) (Bowman and Free, 2006). The carbon (C)

176   use efficiency represents the proportion of acquired carbon that the organisms

177   use to build biomass (Manzoni et al., 2018).

178

179   In  this  study  we  addressed  how  changes  in  chemical  composition  of Pinus

180   sylvestris  needle  litter  were  related  to  gene  content  and  transcription  during

181   decomposition  by  two  litter  decomposer  fungi  with  contrasting  ecological

182   strategies.  We  used  the  experimental  material  presented  in Baskaran et  al.

183   (2019)  and  chemical  data  therein,  derived  from   13C-PMAS-NMR  spectroscopic

184   analyses. Gymnopus  androsaceus  (L.) Della Magg. & Trassin. and Chalara

185   longipes  (Preuss)  Cooke.  are  both  common  colonizers  of  pine  litter  but  with

186   different ecological strategies and abilities regarding decomposition (Baskaran et

187   al.,  2019). G.  androsaceus  is  an  efficient  decomposer   with  high  ligninolytic

188   capacity (Boberg et al., 2011), whereas C. longipes  is characterized by stress

189   tolerance,  endophytic  capacity (Koukol,  2011)  and  lack  of  ligninolytic  ability

190   (Boberg et al., 2011). Baskaran et al.  (2019)  found that in the presence of G.

191   androsaceus,  40% of the needle litter mass was lost during 10 months of

192   incubation, but only 10 % in the presence of C. longipes. Further, G. androsaceus

193   was  able  to  decompose  non-hydrolysable  constituents  of  the  litter,  including

194   aromatic and akyl C, whereas C. longipes  only exploited the hydrolysable litter

195   fraction (mainly polysaccharide O-Alkyl C).

196

197   Here, we sequenced the genomes of the two fungi and analysed gene expression

198   during decomposition. We expected that the differences in decomposer capacity
199   and  ecology  would  be  reflected  in  the  genomes,  in  the  expression  of  genes

200   central for the decomposition machinery, as well as in the expression of genetic

201   markers related to C use efficiency. C use efficiency should decrease with time,

202   due  to  increased  costs  of  mycelial  maintenance  and  the  more  complex

203   decomposing  machinery  required  as  the  substrate  become  increasingly

204   recalcitrant (Manzoni et al., 2018). Further, C use efficiency was expected to be

205   lower for C. longipes, as its stress-tolerant mycelium should have a higher cost of

206   maintenance relative to its slow growth, compared with the rapidly growing G.

207   androsaceus (c.f.  the  C-S-R  ecological  strategies  of Grime  1974   (Cooke  and

208   Rayner, 1984)).

209

210   We hypothesized that:

211       (1) In the genomes, there would be a correlative link between the presence or

212          number  of  genes  with  a  specific  function,  the  biochemical  action  of  a

213          fungus  and its affiliation  to  a  functional  guild.  While  the  gene diversity

214          among relevant GH families would be predictors of cellulose, hemicellulose

215          and  pectin  decomposition,  presence  of  the  AA1  and  AA2  gene  family

216          should be indicative of lignin decomposition. 

217       (2) In the transcriptomes, genes coding for lignocellulolytic enzymes would be

218          expressed  in  sequence  during  the  progressive  decomposition  of

219          hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. The relative expression of genes coding

220          for hydrolases acting on long-chain substrates, including endohydrolases

221          and  processive  enzymes  as  well  as  the  oxidative  AA9)  would  be  high

222          initially,  promoting  subsequent  higher  expression  of  genes  coding  for

223          enzymes that release monosaccharides. Oxidative enzymes (AA1 and AA2)
224          would primarily be expressed at late decomposition stages      (Šnajdr et al.,

225          2011). 

226       (3) We expected that G. androsaceus, growing and decomposing more rapidly,

227          would have a higher CUE than the slowly growing C. longipes       (Manzoni et

228          al., 2018) and  hypothesised that this difference would be reflected in a

229          higher expression ratio of the anabolic enzymes GT48 and GT2 over the

230          catabolic  enzymes  IDH  and  OGDC.  Further,  we  expected  that  CUE  (as

231          indicated by the GT48 and GT2 to IDH and OGDC ratio) would decrease

232          with time and increasing recalcitrance of the substrate.

233

234   Materials and methods

235   Fungal strains and microcosms

236   Strains  of Gymnopus  androsaceus  (isolate  JB14)  and Chalara  longipes  (isolate

237   BDJ)  were  obtained  from  the  culture  collection  of  the  Department  of  Forest

238   Mycology and Plant Pathology at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

239   Details of the microcosm design are described in Baskaran et al. (2019). Briefly, a

240   total of 24 microcosms were filled with 85g of sand and 11g of dry Scots pine

241   needles (Pinus sylvestris) each and sterilised by gamma radiation. The needle

242   litter  contained  0.42%  N,  50.6%    C,  had  a  C:N-ratio  of  120  and  a  lignin

243   concentration  of  approximately  25%    (Boberg et  al.,  2014).  For  each  fungal

244   species,  twelve  microcosms  were  inoculated  through  the  addition  of  single

245   needles that had been pre-colonized for 2 months on N-free agar cultures. After


246   inoculation, 20 ml of 100 mM NH4Cl solution were added to all microcosms, to

247   stimulate  fungal  growth.  Sealed  microcosms  were  incubated  at  20  ºC  and  4
248   replicates from each fungal species were harvested after 2, 5 and 10 months,

249   shock frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground using mortar and pestle and stored at -80

250   ºC.

251   A Bruker 500 MHz Avance III spectrometer equipped with a MAS probe was used

252   to acquire 13CP/MAS spectra (Schaefer and Stejskal, 1976), which were        divided

253   into established spectral regions to quantify the relative contribution of O-Alkyl C,

254   Alkyl C, Aromatic C and Carboxyl C.

255

256   DNA  and  RNA  extraction  for  genome  sequencing,  assembly  and

257   annotation.

258   C.  longipes  BDJ was cultured in liquid Hagem medium for 30 days and G.

259   androsaceus   JB14 was  cultured in liquid  medium with 1.75% malt and  0.25%

260   peptone  for 16  days.  Mycelium was freeze-dried and ground in a mortar and

261   pestle with sand, and 1-5 mL was used for DNA and RNA extraction. DNA was

262   extracted following a 3% CTAB-buffer/chloroform protocol (supplementary method

263   A).  RNA  was  extracted  with  2%        CTAB-buffer/chloroform-isoamyl  alcohol

264   (supplementary method B) and purified following the protocol of the RNeasy mini

265   kit (Qiagen).

266   G. androsaceus  (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Gyman1/Gyman1.home.html) and C.

267   longipes (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Chalo1/Chalo1.info.html) were sequenced by

268   the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) using a combination of

269   Illumina fragment (270 bp insert size) and 4 Kbp long mate-pair (LMP) libraries,

270   and assembled using ALLPATHS-LG. G. androsaceus  was improved with PacBio

271   and  PBJelly.  The  genomes  were  annotated  using  the  JGI  annotation  pipeline

272   (Grigoriev et  al.,  2014)  and  are  available  via  the  JGI  MycoCosm   database
273   (jgi.doe.gov/fungi).  Transcriptomes  of  the  two  species  produced  at  JGI  were

274   sequenced  using  Illumina,  assembled  using  Rnnotator  and  used  for  genome

275   annotation (Kohler et al., 2015).

276

277   RNA extraction from microcosm, sequencing and data processing 

278   Total  RNA  was  extracted  from  800  mg  of  tissue  per  sample  using  the  RNA

279   PowerSoil Total RNA Isolation Kit (Mobio now Qiagen). Quantification and integrity

280   check were conducted using an Experion Automated Electrophoresis Station (Bio-

281   Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Preparation of libraries (IlluminaTruSeq Stranded mRNA)

282   and  2  x  125  bp  Illumina  HiSeq2500  sequencing  was  performed  by  the  GeT

283   platform (Get‐PlaGe GenoToul, Castanet‐Tolosan, France) following their standard

284   protocol.  Three  replicates  were  sequenced  except  for C. longipes  mycelium

285   harvested after 2 and 5 month. For these two time points the amount of fungal

286   material was only sufficient to extract good quality RNA for two replicates. Raw

287   reads were trimmed for low quality (quality score 0.05), Illumina adapters and

288   sequences shorter than 15 nucleotides and aligned to the respective reference

289   transcripts available  at  JGI  (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/programs/fungi/index.jsf)

290   using the CLC Genomics Workbench v9. The following CLC genomic workbench

291   parameters were used for read mapping: minimum length fraction 0.9, minimum

292   similarity fraction 0.8, Mismatch cost = 2, insertion cost = 3, Deletion cost = 3,

293   and the maximum number of hits for a read was set to 10. The unique and total

294   mapped reads number for each transcript were determined and then normalized

295   to RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads). Intact

296   pairs were counted as two, broken pairs as one.      The complete data sets were

297   submitted to NCBI GEO as GSEXXX. 
298

299   Analysis of gene expression in microcosms

300   Specific gene families were selected from the CAZyme database (Lombard et al.,

301   2014) or based on literature (Barbi et al., 2014; Treseder and Lennon, 2015)  In

302   the  specific  cases  of  the GH2  family,  only  beta-mannosidases  were  selected

303   based on JGI annotations (Table1). The number of genes in each selected gene

304   family  were  integrated  across  the  two  fungal  genomes,  and  the  normalized

305   number (RPKM) of sequenced transcripts were assessed. Statistical analyses were

306   performed using R (v3.3.1) with “vegan” packages (Oksanen et al., 2019; R Core

307   Team,  2019).  Changes  in  global  patterns  of  gene  expression  during  the

308   experiment  were  analysed  by  Principal  Component  Analysis  (PCA)  based  on

309   mean-normalized expression values. Patterns of gene expression were related to

310   changes in chemical composition of the decomposing litter by fitting vectors of C

311   fraction  ratios  (Table  2)  to  the  PCA.  Specific  correlations  between  expression

312   ratios of genes from specific families and time or C fraction ratios were analysed

313   post-hoc by linear regression.

315   Results

316   The 89 Mbp genome of G. androsaceus contained 29375 genes, of which 409

317   (1.4%) were identified as belonging to different GH families, while the 52 Mbp

318   genome of C. longipes  contained a total of 19765 genes, of which 429 (2.2%)

319   were                identified               as               GH                genes

320   (https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/Gyman1/Gyman1.home.html, https://genome.jgi.doe.

321   gov/Chalo1/Chalo1.home.html) (Table S1).

322
323   The genome of C. longipes contained a somewhat higher number of genes coding

324   for β-glucosidases (GH1 and GH3) and cellulolytic enzymes (GH5_5, GH6, and

325   GH7) as that of G. androsaceus (56 vs. 52) (Fig. 1A; Table S1). C. longipes had 93

326   genes potentially involved in xylan decomposition (GH10, GH11, GH115, GH27,

327   GH3, GH35, GH36, GH43, GH51, GH54, GH62 and GH67), whereas G. androsaceus

328   had only 64. A high number of genes involved in hemicellulose decomposition

329   seems  to  be  a  common  feature  of  Leotiomycetes,  which  in  addition  to  litter

330   saprotrophs, such as C. longipes, also include endophytes and species forming

331   ericoid mycorrhiza (Fig. S1). C. longipes had 34 genes involved in galactomannan

332   decomposition  (GH5_7,  GH5_31,  GH27,  GH26,  GH35  and  GH36),  whereas G.

333   androsaceus had only 24 genes. Both fungi contained a similar number of genes

334   involved in xyloglucan decomposition (GH12, GH27, GH29, GH31, GH35, GH36,

335   GH51, GH54, GH74 and GH95; 48 and 47 for C. longipes  and G. androsaceus,

336   respectively) (Fig. 1C; Fig S2; Table S1). C. longipes  had 46 genes involved in

337   pectin decomposition, whereas G. androsaceus had only 32 (Fig. 1E). Regarding

338   lignin breakdown, C. longipes had 28 genes annotated as multicopper oxidases,

339   whereas G. androsaceus had 32 (Fig. 1G). Moreover, no genes coding for versatile

340   or lignin peroxidase were identified in the genomes of any of the fungi, but     the

341   genome of G. androsaceus  contained 10 genes coding for class II peroxidases

342   (AA2) that were further classified as Manganese Peroxidases. C. longipes, similar

343   to other ascomycetes, had 4 class II peroxidases with missing key residues for Mn

344   oxidation (ExxxE and D) and these have no conserved tryptophan residue (Fawal

345   et  al.,  2013).  These  enzymes  have  been  classified  as  ascomycete  class  II

346   peroxidases or as “generic peroxidases” (Floudas et al., 2012).

347
348   Transcriptomes  were  successfully  sequenced  from        9  microcosms  with     G.

349   androsaceus (3 from each harvest) and from 7 microcosms with C. longipes (2 x 2

350   months, 2 x 5 months and 3 x 10 months). In contrast to the lower number of GH

351   genes in the genome of G. androsaceus, the overall expression of β-glucosidases

352   and cellulase genes were 8 times higher for G. androsaceus than for C. longipes

353   (Fig. 1B), and genes coding for hemicellulases and pectin lyases were also more

354   highly expressed by G. androsaceus  (Fig. 1D;  Fig.  1F;  Fig.  S2). Among  genes

355   involved in cellulose depolymerisation, C. longipes had 1.3 times more transcripts

356   coding for β-glucosidases (GH1 and GH3) than for cellulases (GH5_5, GH6 and

357   GH7), whereas G. androsaceus had higher relative expression of cellulases, with

358   an average GH1+3 to GH5_5+6+7 ratio of 0.17 (Fig. 1A).

359

360   Gene expression during decomposition

361   For G. androsaceus, changes in chemical composition of the litter followed a clear

362   temporal dynamic (Fig. 2A) from month 2 (top left) to month 10 (middle right)

363   (Baskaran et al., 2019). The overall pattern of gene expression changed during

364   the  progression  of  the  experiment,  as  indicated  by  the  clustering  of

365   transcriptomes according to harvest time in the mean-normalized PCA, as well as

366   by the significant correlation between mass remaining and the PCA ordination

367   axes (P=0.016). Changes in gene transcription occurred in parallel with changes

368   in chemical composition of the litter, as indicated by the significant correlations

369   between different C fraction ratios, as analysed by NMR, and the PCA ordination

370   axes (Aromatic C to O-Alkyl C, P=0.015; Alkyl C to O-Alkyl C, P=0.026; Carboxyl C

371   to O-Alkyl C, P=0.032) (Fig. 2).

372
373   Expression of G. androsaceus genes coding for cellulolytic enzymes acting on long

374   chains  (GH5_5,  GH6  and  GH7)  increased  during  the  experiment,  whereas  the

375   global expression level of β-glucosidase coding genes that release glucose (GH1

376   and GH3) was stable, and many β-glucosidase genes were more highly expressed

377   at month 2 and 5 compare to month 10 (Fig 2B; Fig S3A). The ratio of expression

378   between  cellulases  and  β-glucosidases  transcripts  (i.e.  the  ratio  of

379   GH5_5+GH6+GH7  to  GH1+GH3)  increased  significantly  with  time  (Fig.              3A)

380   (R2=0.897, P=0.001) and was correlated with the Carboxyl C to O-Alkyl C ratio,

381   which  is  an  indicator  of  increasing  decomposition  (G.  androsaceus  R2=0.787,

382   P=0.001) (Fig. 3A).

383

384   Similarly,  considering G.  androsaceus  genes  coding  for  hemicellulases,  we

385   observed  that  genes  coding  for  monosaccharide  releasing  enzymes  were

386   relatively more expressed during the early stages of the experiment, whereas

387   genes coding for long-chain acting enzymes were more highly expressed at later

388   stages (Fig. 2B and 2C). With the exception of one GH26 and one GH5_7, genes

389   coding  for  enzymes  targeting  general  hemicellulose  substrates  and

390   galactomannan  (i.e.  GH2,  GH26,  GH27,  GH35,  GH5_7  and  GH5_31)  had  their

391   maximum of expression at early stages. Pectinase encoding genes (GH28, GH55,

392   CE8 (CE=Carbohydrate Esterases) and PL1 (PL=Polysaccharide Lyases)) tended

393   to be highly expressed at intermediate stages of decomposition (Fig. S6). On the

394   contrary, enzymes targeting xylan and xyloglucan (i.e. GH10, GH11, GH12) were

395   mainly expressed at later stages (Fig. 2D). 

396
397   Most of the G. androsaceus AA9 genes were highly expressed at month 2 but less

398   pronounced over time (Fig. 2B; Fig. 3C). AA2 genes had a maximum expression

399   level at month 5 (Fig. 2B). Although the correlation between the ratio of Aromatic

400   C  to  O-Alkyl  C  and  the  AA2  transcript  expression  level  was  only  marginally

401   significant (R2=0.296, p-value=0.129) (Fig. S5A), there was a trend that the lignin

402   to polysaccharides ratio decreased when transcription of AA2 genes was high

403   (Fig. 3B). AA1 genes, coding for multicopper oxidases, were expressed throughout

404   the experiment without a significant correlation (R2=0.183, p-value=0.25) with

405   substrate chemical composition (Fig. S5C).

406

407   For C. longipes  directional changes in gene expression levels were less obvious

408   (Fig.  S4A;  Fig.  S6).  Due  to  the  lack  of  good  replication  for C.  longipes,

409   interpretation of gene expression dynamics is ambiguous. Actually, neither mass

410   loss nor C fraction ratios were significantly correlated with the PCA ordination

411   (P>0.5).   Nonetheless,  it  appeared  that  genes  coding  for  long-chain  acting

412   enzymes (GH5_5, GH5_7, GH6, GH7, GH10, GH11) as well as LPMO (AA9) were

413   relatively  more  highly  expressed  at  later  stages,  whereas  genes  coding  for

414   monosaccharide releasing enzymes (GH1, GH3, GH2, GH27 and GH35) were more

415   expressed at early stages (Fig. S4B and S4C; Fig. S3B). Moreover, C. longipes

416   genes coding for ascomycetes class II peroxidases (AA2) were not significantly

417   expressed, and AA1 expression was much lower than for G. androsaceus (Fig.

418   1H).

419

420   It was visually obvious that G. androsaceus grew more vividly than C. longipes. It

421   also decomposed the organic matter four times more rapidly and the gradual
422   substitution of plant derived organic matter to organic matter derived from fungal

423   mycelium was indicated by a gradual increase in the ratio of Alkyl C to O-Alkyl C

424   in  presence  of G.  androsaceus  (Fig.  4) (Baskaran et  al.,  2019).  We  used  the

425   expression ratio of genes coding for the GT48 and GT2 families (β-1,3-glucan

426   synthase and chitin synthase) over the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and the


427   oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDC) (responsible for CO2 production in

428   the citric acid cycle) as an indicator of C use efficiency. This expression ratio was

429   3 times higher for G.  androsaceus  than  for C. longipes  and  stable  over  the

430   duration of the experiment (Fig 3D).

431

432   Discussion

433   We related gene content and transcriptional patterns to chemical changes during

434   litter  decomposition  by  two  saprotrophic  fungi  with  contrasting  ecological

435   strategies. Contrary to our presupposition, the presence or diversity of functional

436   genes in the two genomes did not reflect the performance of the two fungi during

437   decomposition.  Although C. longipes  was a  weak decomposer  of holocellulose

438   compared to G. androsaceus      (Baskaran et al., 2019), we found that C. longipes

439   had a higher number of transcribed genes coding for enzymes involved in

440   cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin decomposition than G. androsaceus  (Fig. 1;

441   Fig. S1; Fig. S2). However, the expression levels for genes considered as markers

442   for plant cell wall decomposition were considerably higher for G. androsaceus

443   than for C. longipes, with an almost 8 times higher average expression of genes

444   coding  for  cellulases  and  β-glucosidases  and  9  times  higher  expression  of

445   hemicellulose genes, as well as 4.5 time higher expression of pectinase genes

446   over the time course of the experiment (Fig. 1; Fig. S2). Thus, fungal gene
447   expression was a better predictor of cell-wall polysaccharides decomposition than

448   gene content, indicating that genomic information do not suffice to understand

449   functional differences between fungi of different ecological strategies.

450

451   In  this  context,  one  may  consider  the  recent  evolutionary  history  and  larger

452   genomes of fungi relative to bacteria, which commonly have smaller genomes

453   that  are  highly  optimized  according  to  environmental  selection  pressure

454   (Martínez-Cano et  al.,  2015).  Compared  to  bacteria,  fungi  may  be  considered

455   metabolically  similar,  with  sugars  as  their  principal  energy  source.  Thus,

456   ecological strategies among fungi primarily relate to differences in the way they

457   use extracellular processes and host interactions to acquire sugars. In some cases

458   systematic genomic differences have been identified, e.g. between mycorrhizal

459   and saprotrophic basidiomycetes (Kohler et al., 2015) or between different modes

460   of wood decomposition (Riley et al., 2014; Hori et al., 2018). In contrast, our

461   findings  indicate  that  the  distinct  ecological  strategies  of  two  fungal  litter

462   saprotrophs were largely regulated at the transcriptional level with a high degree

463   of  genomic  redundancy.  Rather  than  indicating  extensive  decomposition

464   capabilities,  the  diverse  set  of  genes  involved  in  cell-wall  polysaccharides

465   decomposition of C. longipes could reflect a high degree of ecological resilience

466   and flexibility. Generally, Leotiomycetes (to which C. longipes  belongs) have a

467   broader  tolerance  to  constrained  nutrient  availability  and  low  pH  than

468   Agaricomycetes (to which G. androsaceus  belongs) (Sterkenburg et al., 2015).

469   Further, C. longipes may colonise living needles as an endophyte (Koukol, 2011),

470   and  this  versatile  ecology  may  be  comparable  to  ericoid  mycorrhizal

471   Leotiomycetes, which have been proposed to switch between biotrophism and
472   saprotrophism  and  also  have  a  high  content  of  genes  involved  in  cell-wall

473   polysaccharide decomposition (Martino et al., 2018) (Fig. S1).

474

475   In contrast to the stress tolerant, versatile strategy of C. longipes, the potent

476   decomposer  capacity  of  the  highly  competitive G.  androsaceus  seems  to  be

477   related to high expression of a limited number of keystone genes. Its single gene

478   within the GH6 family, beneficial for cleavage of crystalline cellulose (Payne et al.,

479   2015), was highly transcribed at an almost 40 times higher rate than the three

480   GH6 genes of C. longipes, suggesting a keystone role of GH6 transcription for

481   cellulose  decomposition  (Fig.  1).  The  presence  of  10  AA2  genes  (MnP)  in G.

482   androsaceus confirms the pivotal role of extracellular peroxidases for overall plant

483   cell-wall decomposition (Floudas et al., 2012), particularly in boreal ecosystems

484   (Kyaschenko et al., 2017; Stendahl et al., 2017). While G. androsaceus was able

485   to cause significant mass loss of non-hydrolysable litter components, C. longipes,

486   with  only  four  non-expressed  genes  coding  for  “generic”  ascomycete  class  II

487   peroxidases and  a  low  expression  of  AA1  genes  (multicopper  oxidases  incl.

488   laccases), was unable to attack this fraction (Baskaran et al., 2019). 

489

490   We  hypothesized  that  genes  coding  for  plant  cell  wall  decomposing  enzymes

491   would be sequentially expressed as decomposition progressed, with long-chain

492   acting  enzymes  initiating  the  process,  monosaccharide-releasing  enzymes

493   increasing  in  relative  importance  with  time,  and  oxidative  enzymes  primarily

494   being produced at late stages of decomposition. On the contrary, we found that

495   genes coding for enzymes acting on long chains (including the cellulases of GH6

496   and  GH7  as  well  as  endoxylanases,  xyloglucan  endoglucanases  and
497   endomannanases belonging to the families GH10, GH11, GH12, GH5 and GH26)

498   were most expressed towards the end of the experiment, whereas genes coding

499   for  monosaccharide-releasing  β-glucosidases  (GH1  and  GH3),  β-mannosidases

500   (GH2), galactosidases (GH 27 and GH35) and pectinases (GH28, GH55, PL1, CE8)

501   were expressed also during early stages of decomposition (Fig. 2, Fig. S3, Fig S6).

502   For both fungi the expression ratio of cellulases (GH5_5, GH6 and GH7) to β-

503   glucosidases  (GH1  and  GH3)  increased  over  time  with  a  higher  ratio  for G.

504   androsaceus  (Fig. 3A). Further, the cellulases to β-glucosidases expression ratio

505   also increased as the Carboxyl C to O-Alkyl C ratio increased (Fig. 2; Fig. 3A),

506   which indicates loss of polysaccharides in relation to more stable compounds.

507   Thus,  counterintuitively,  production  of  long-chain  acting  enzymes  seemed  to

508   increase as the pool of hydrolysable polysaccharides was depleted. These results

509   partly  agrees  with  the  dynamics  of  enzyme  activities  in  other  decomposition

510   experiments (Šnajdr et al., 2011; Presley et al., 2018). 

511

512   Based on these observations, we conceptualise that the polysaccharides of the

513   plant cell wall do not constitute a homogenous pool with respect to susceptibility

514   to enzymatic hydrolysis, but rather a spectrum from long unbranched molecules

515   to highly branched and cross-linked structures. Linear chains may be efficiently

516   hydrolysed  by  a  minimum      of  internal  chain  cleavages,  followed  by  rapid

517   depolymerisation  by  processive  (non-releasing)  enzymes,  leading  to  ample

518   production  of  small  polysaccharides.  These,  in  turn,  require  high  activity  of

519   monosaccharide-releasing enzymes for sugars to become available for uptake. As

520   susceptible substrates are depleted, the proportion of branched and cross-linked

521   polysaccharides raises, and thus increasing the demand for internal cleavage and
522   chain-end formation. Further, cross-linking and branching efficiently disrupt the

523   processive mechanism of non-releasing hydrolases, leading to a lower production

524   of  small  polysaccharides (Yoshida et  al.,  2008)  (Fig.  5).  Thus,  the  increasing

525   expression of genes coding for long-chain active enzymes with time should not be

526   interpreted as accelerating rate of decomposition, but rather as a response to

527   decreasing availability of susceptible substrates and a lower output of products

528   per enzymatic reaction event. 

529

530   Another interpretation would be that crystalline cellulose – the primary target of

531   enzymes in the GH6 and GH7 families – is less readily hydrolysed than amorphous

532   cellulose and hemicellulose and thus remains until later stages of decomposition,

533   motivating late expression of GH6 and GH7 encoding genes. However, this theory

534   disagrees with our observations that genes coding for AA9 enzymes (LPMO) –

535   instrumental for the initiation of degradation of crystalline cellulose (Hu et al.,

536   2014)  –  were  expressed  primarily  during  early  stages  (for G.  androsaceus),

537   whereas  genes  related  to  decomposition  of  xylan  and  xyloglucan  –  the  main

538   hemicelluloses of the secondary cell wall of softwood (Shrotri et al., 2017) – were

539   primarily expressed at later stages (Fig. 2D).

540

541   In light of our results we suggest that the expression ratio of GH5_5+GH6+GH7 to

542   GH1+GH3 could be used as a marker of declining substrate quality, with low

543   ratios indicating opportunistic use of more labile substrates, whereas a high ratio

544   indicate  more  efficient  resource  utilization,  also  targeting  more  recalcitrant

545   compounds. 

546
547   In  the  case  of  C.  longipes,  which  did  not  use  oxidative  mechanisms  for

548   ligninolysis, the Aromatic C to O-Alkyl C ratio increased with time (Fig S5B) as

549   holocellulose was degraded. In contrast, in G. androsaceus, this ratio decreased

550   concurrently with an increase in AA2 gene expression from month 2 to month 5

551   (Fig 3B). Although the correlation was not clearly significant, we observed a trend

552   of lower Aromatic-C to O-Alkyl-C ratio when AA2 gene expression was higher (Fig

553   S5A).  This  may  indicate  that,  after  initial  consumption  of  susceptible

554   polysaccharides,  the  proportion  of  lignin  increases,  and  cross-linking  between

555   polysaccharides  and  lignin    (Iiyama   et  al.,  1994)  may  impede  hydrolytic

556   depolymerisation (Yoshida et  al.,  2008).  This  view  is  congruent  with  the

557   increasing  ratio  of  Aromatic  C  over  O-Alkyl  C  in C.  longipes, but with the

558   ligninolytic G.  androsaceus  the  chemical barrier to  hydrolysis  may  have  been

559   counter-acted  by  peroxidases  making  new  polysaccharides  susceptible  to

560   depolymerisation. The relatively early expression of AA2 genes and many AA1

561   genes in G. androsaceus was in disagreement with our original hypothesis, as well

562   as with the result of Šnajdr et al. (2011), who observed increasing Mn-peroxidase

563   and laccase activity at late decomposition stages. Earlier expression of oxidative

564   enzymes during decomposition of pine needles may be explained by the high

565   proportion  of  O-Alkyl  C  in  the  non-hydrolysable  pool (Baskaran et  al.,  2019),

566   potentially  cross-linked  to  lignin (Iiyama et  al.,  1994).  Moreover,  sequential

567   patterns of decomposition observed in the field may also reflect the ecological

568   succession of fungi during litter decomposition, in which initial decomposition by

569   endophytic  ascomycetes  is  replaced  by  the  later  action  of  basidiomycetes

570   (Voříšková and Baldrian, 2013).

571
572   The  lytic  polysaccharide  monooxygenases  (LPMO)  of  the  AA9  family  are,

573   supposedly,  secreted  during  the  early  steps  of  the  decomposition  process

574   (Couturier et  al.,  2015)  and  act  in  synergy  with  cellulases  to  enhance  their

575   decomposition  capacity (Harris et  al.,  2010;  Hu et  al.,  2014;  Couturier et  al.,

576   2016). This idea is in agreement with our observations of G. androsaceus, where

577   AA9  gene  expression  declined  as  decomposition  progressed  and  the  more

578   efficient oxidative AA2  enzymes        were  induced  (Fig. 2B;  Fig. 3C). However, C.

579   longipes without expressed AA2 coding genes and low AA1 gene expression was

580   unable  to  attack  lignin,  and  when  susceptible  polysaccharides  were  depleted,

581   expression of AA9 increased (Fig. 3C; Fig. S4B).

582

583   After uptake of decomposition products, carbohydrates are partitioned between

584   catabolic and anabolic metabolic pathways. The expression ratio of genes coding

585   for enzymes involved in the synthesis of the two principal components of the

586   fungal cell wall, namely β-1.3 glucan and chitin (i.e. GT48 and GT2) over genes

587   coding for central enzymes of the respiration (i.e. IDH and OGDC in the Citric acid

588   cycle) was much higher in G. androsaceus than C. longipes (Fig. 3D). This higher

589   expression ratio is indicative of a higher CUE for G. androsaceus, in line with our

590   initial hypothesis and the intense mycelial growth of G. androsaceus observed in

591   the microcosms (Fig. 4). C. longipes had a similar expression of genes associated


592   with CO2 production, but lower expression of GT48 and GT2 genes, in line with its

593   meagre  mycelial  growth.  However,  contrary  to  our  hypothesis  the  gene

594   expression  indicator  of  CUE  ratio  remained  constant  over  the  experiment,

595   indicating  that  the  partitioning  of  acquired  resources  between  growth  and

596   respiration was not altered by decreasing chemical quality of the substrate or
597   mycelial senescence. Thus, the increasing enzyme production in more recalcitrant

598   materials, as indicated by the upregulated transcription of CAZyme genes with

599   time, seems not to be associated with a major respiratory cost. However, the

600   markers we used to reflect respiration are putative, and careful analyses of gene


601   expression and CO2 production in parallel are needed. Our observations may be

602   interpreted  within  the  C-S-R  theoretical  framework  (Grime,  1977;  Cooke  and

603   Rayner, 1984; Crowther et al. 2014), with C. longipes having stress-tolerant traits,

604   such as  a versatile but  inefficient  decomposition machinery and low resource

605   allocation  to  mycelial  growth.  In  contrast,  the  traits  of G.  androsaceus  are

606   congruent  with  a  C-strategy,  with  higher  biomass  production  and  efficient

607   exploitation of organic matter resources.

608

609   To conclude, expression analysis of specific genetic markers seems to be useful

610   to assess fungal ecological strategies, providing information about the dynamics

611   of ecophysiological processes, such as decomposition. By targeting transcription

612   ratios  of  specific  ‘keystone’  genes  at  the  ecosystem  scale  (i.e. meta-

613   transcriptomics), information about the interplay between the fungal communities

614   and their environment may be derived that could be used to decipher the role of

615   fungi as mediators of ecosystem responses to environmental change (Lindahl and

616   Kuske, 2013; Treseder and Lennon, 2015).

893   Figure 5. Conceptual figure of plant polysaccharide pools hydrolysis over time.

894   Plant cell wall constitutes a spectrum from long unbranched molecules to highly

895   branched  and  cross-linked  structures. (Top  frame)  At  the  beginning  of  the

896   decomposition process, long unbranched molecules are efficiently hydrolysed by

897   few  long-chain  acting  enzymes  and  require  high  activity  of  monosaccharide-

898   releasing enzymes for sugars to become available for uptake. (Bottom frame) In

899   later  stage  of  decomposition  process,  the  higher  proportion  of  branched  and

900   cross-linked structures increase the demand for internal cleavage and chain-end

901   formation performed by long-chain acting enzymes an require equivalent or lower

902   activity of monosaccharide-releasing enzymes. Consequently with the progress of

903   decomposition  the  ratio  of  long-chain  acting  enzymes  to  monosaccharide-

904   releasing enzymes increase.
